<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The story of the exploration of Australia is
one which we cannot willingly let die. There are
many reasons for keeping alive the remembrance of
such heroic deeds. It is due to the memory of those
men who took their lives in their hands, and, in many
cases, laid their bones in the desert; it is an act of
gratitude on our part, who have entered on their
labours; and it is a kind of information indispensable
to every Australian who desires to know the history
of his country. And yet there is great danger of their
being practically forgotten. The time when the
harvest of discovery was reaped has faded into the
past, and a generation is growing up not well
informed on these most interesting adventures and
achievements. Nor are the sources of information easily
obtainable by those who purposely put themselves on
the search. The journals of the explorers, never too
plentiful, have now become scarce. They are only
occasionally met with in private hands, where they
are, for good reasons, held as a treasure. A considerable
number of these works are to be found in the Sydney
School of Arts, but they have been withdrawn from
circulation, and are now kept for special reference
only, in a glass case, under lock and key. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Government Library contains the best collection
extant, but even there it has been deemed necessary to
adopt restrictive regulations, with the view of giving
the books a longer lease of existence. This scarcity
of the sources of information, and these restrictions
which fence in the few that remain, may be accepted
as a sufficient plea for the effort here made to
popularize the knowledge they contain. But I would
warn the reader not to expect from this small volume
what it does not profess to give. In no sense does it
pretend to be elaborate or exhaustive. I have had to
study brevity for another reason than its being the
soul of wit. It would have been a pleasant task to
write long descriptions of Australian scenery, and to
follow the explorers even into the by-paths of their
journeys; but the result would have been just what I
have had to avoid&mdash;a bulky volume. Yet, such as it
is, I hope the book will be found acceptable to the man
of business, who can neither afford to be ignorant of
this subject nor find time to enter into its minuti√¶;
to the youth of our country, who cannot obtain access
to the original sources; and to the general reader, who
desires to be told in simple, artless language the main
outlines of this fascinating story.</p>

<p>Having written on a subject in no way connected
with my profession, I may be allowed to say, in a
word, how my thoughts came to be diverted into this
channel. Probably they would never have been so
directed to any great extent had it not happened that
the path of duty led me into the tracks of several of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg vii]</a></span>
the most eminent explorers. In earlier days it was my
lot to travel, in the service of the Gospel, most extensively
in the interior of Queensland, principally on
the lines of the Condamine, the Dawson, the Balonne,
the Maranoa, and the Warrego rivers. In these
situations it was natural to wish for information as to
the way and manner in which those pastoral regions
had been opened up for settlement. Not much was
to be gleaned from the occupants themselves; but it
fortunately happened that Sir Thomas Mitchell's
journal fell into my hands when amidst the scenes
of one of his most splendid discoveries, the Fitzroy
Downs, and almost under the shadow of his well-named
Mount Abundance. The taste then obtained
was sufficient to whet the appetite for more, and the
prosecution of this favourite study has issued in
what I may be permitted to call a tolerable acquaintance
with the exploration of Australia. About seven
or eight years ago I wrote a series of papers on this
subject for the <i>Sydney Mail</i>, bringing the history
down to the expedition of Burke and Wills. The
proprietors of that journal have kindly permitted me
to make use of my former articles in the preparation
of this work; but of this permission, for which I
would here record my thanks, I have availed myself
only to a moderate extent. The whole has been rewritten,
some inadvertencies have been corrected, and
the history in its main outlines brought down to the
present time. Although my principal concern has
been with the land explorers, I have, in the introduction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg viii]</a></span>
given a sketch of the discoveries made on our
coasts by the navigators. So much was necessary to
the completeness of my plan, and also because the
achievements of both to some extent dovetail into
one another. In the arrangement of the succeeding
chapters I have followed the chronological order,
except in a very few cases where a more important
principle of classification will be obvious to the
reader.</p>

<p>As regards authorities, I have spared no pains to
get at the original sources of information, and have
succeeded in all but a few unimportant exceptions.
In these cases I have derived some help from interviews
with surviving relatives of the explorers and
several very old colonists. I have also been indebted
for further light to works of acknowledged merit
which have been for some time before the public&mdash;notably,
to the Rev. J. E. Tenison Woods's "<a href = "http://openlibrary.org/works/OL7891829W/A_History_of_the_Discovery_and_Exploration_of_Australia_Or_An_Account_of_..">Exploration
of Australia</a>," and to Mr. Howitt's "<a href = "http://openlibrary.org/works/OL5207640W/The_history_of_discovery_in_Australia_Tasmania_and_New_Zealand">Discoveries
in Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand</a>." My best
acknowledgments are also due to the Honourable
P. G. King, Esq., M.L.C., for the excellent notes he
has written on the discoveries made by his distinguished
father, Admiral King.</p>

<p>The eastern coast of New Holland, as Australia was
then called, was discovered by Captain Cook, while
engaged in the first of his voyages round the world.
Leaving Cape Farewell, in New Zealand, on the 13th
of March, 1770, and steering a north-westerly course,
on the 18th of April he found the new continent rise
into view in one of its south-eastern headlands, which
was then named Point Hicks, but is now known as
Cape Conran, and reckoned within the territory of
Victoria. Henceforward the <i>Endeavour</i> was navigated
along the coast to its most northern limit. In
these southern waters no practicable landing-place
was observed till Botany Bay was reached. Here the
good ship came to anchor, and nearly a week was
passed amidst the strangest sights and scenes. This
brief interlude being over, the northern voyage was
resumed in quest of further discoveries. Scarcely
had the Botany Heads faded from the view when
another large inlet was sighted from the deck of
the vessel, but, unhappily, not visited. The point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of observation being miserably inadequate, the great
navigator was all unconscious of his being abreast of
the finest harbour of the world, and having given it
the name of Port Jackson, in honour of a distinguished
English friend, held on his course without
pause or delay. For a while all went well with the
navigator, but in an hour when no danger was
expected a cry of "breakers ahead" brought to
everyone on board a sense of extreme peril. By dint
of the captain's superior seamanship, and his perfect
command over the crew, the ship was turned from the
rocks in a critical moment, and the expedition rescued
from a disastrous termination. The locality of this
threatened calamity was marked by a projection of the
land, overhung by a conspicuous hill, to which Cook
gave the respective names of Point Danger and Mount
Warning, positions which the reader will recognize as
now forming the coastal boundary between New
South Wales and Queensland. But the <i>Endeavour</i>
was not to finish her voyage without making a still
closer acquaintance with misfortune. Having unconsciously
approached a hidden danger in the far
north, she landed bodily on a reef, and sustained most
serious damage. It was only after the sacrifice of
much valuable cargo that she could be floated, and
then it taxed all the skill of the captain and the
utmost energies of his crew to bring her to the nearest
anchorage. The port of safety, reached with so much
difficulty, proved to be the mouth of a small river,
which has since borne the name of the Endeavour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 3]</a></span>
The repair of the crazy vessel occupied a period of six
weeks, during which "Jack ashore" enjoyed rather
exciting holidays, making his first acquaintance with
the kangaroo and other grotesque oddities of the
Australian fauna. Having again put to sea, only one
stage more remained, and this over, the great navigator
reached Cape York, the extreme northern limit
of this new territory. Cook succeeded in his object
to a degree that must have surpassed his most
sanguine anticipations, and now took care that his
labours should not be in vain, but redound to the
benefit of his country. All that was wanting was a
declaration of ownership, and this he accordingly
made on the spot: "As I am now about to quit the
eastern coast of New Holland, which I have coasted
from 38¬∞ latitude to this place, and which I am
confident no European has ever seen before, I once
more hoist the English colours (although I have
already taken possession of the whole eastern coast by
the name of New South Wales, from its great
similarity to that part of the principality of Wales),
in the right of my sovereign, George III., King of
Great Britain."</p>

<p>This welcome gift fell into the hands of the nation
in a time of need. Transportation to Virginia having
come to an end through the revolt of the American
colonies, the English gaols were being filled to overflow
with criminals, and a new outlet was imperatively
required. Somewhere in the world a place had to be
found for a penal settlement. The publication of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Cook's discoveries came in the nick of time, and
delivered the Government from embarrassment. It
was resolved accordingly to establish a crown colony
at Botany Bay, which had been fully and only too
favourably described by the circumnavigator. On the
18th of March, 1787, a fleet consisting of eleven ships,
carrying 757 convicts and 200 soldiers, was despatched
under the command of Captain Phillip, a retired
military officer. The voyage being somewhat circuitous,
its destination was not reached till the 18th
of January following. Less than a week sufficed to
show that Cook's picture of Botany had more of colour
than correctness. The shores were found to be shallow,
the roadstead exposed, and the adjacent land ill suited
to the purpose in view. Without loss of time, the
Governor, with his assistants, proceeded to examine
the capabilities of Port Jackson, which had been
cursorily seen at a distance by Cook and dismissed
in a single sentence of his otherwise copious
narrative. The exploration issued in unmeasured
satisfaction and surprise. The party returned to the
encampment with the tidings of a harbour with a
hundred coves, on the ample bosom of which all the
navies of Europe might ride at anchor. Orders to
decamp were issued forthwith, and the removal of the
nascent colony was the work of but a day or two. The
spot selected for the permanent home is contiguous to
the modern Circular Quay, and was recommended for
acceptance by a clear and limpid stream that glided on
its course underneath the indigenous copse. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
infant colony had its baptism of hardship, but was
able to survive the struggle for existence. The
inauguration took place on the 7th of February, 1788,
when the settlement was formally proclaimed a crown
colony, in circumstances of no small state and
ceremony.</p>

<p>The passion for discovery soon took possession of
the new arrivals, and the adventurous Governor placed
himself in the front of this enterprise. To us who live
in times when Australia has ceased to be an unknown
land, their efforts in this direction may appear to have
been small and the results insignificant, but it should
not be forgotten that the horizon was at that time the
limit of discovery, even in meagre outline, whilst an
accurate survey had scarcely proceeded a couple of
miles beyond the settlement. On the 2nd of May the
Governor and party sailed off in the long-boat for the
purpose of exploring Broken Bay, which had been
seen and named by Captain Cook, but not entered.
It proved to be the entrance to a large river, expanding
to an immense width, and abounding in
exquisite natural scenery. Having crossed the bar,
three distinct divisions of Broken Bay were explored,
and to the last of which they gave the name of Pitt
Water, in honour of the far-famed English premier.
Next year this success was followed up with the
exploration of the river (the Hawkesbury) which here
enters the sea. Large tracts of rich alluvial land were
found on both sides. In a short time hence these
fertile flats became the homes of an industrious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 6]</a></span>
agricultural population, who frequently saved Sydney
from the horrors of famine. This voyage of discovery
was continued as far as Richmond Hill (the Kurrajong),
from which position the chasm in the mountains was
distinctly seen, and the sentries which guard its
entrance named the Carmarthen and Lansdown Hills.</p>

<p>It was the exploration of the coast-line, however,
that principally engaged the attention of the infant
colony, and for this work two men of rare ability
stepped to the front. In 1795, just seven years after
the foundation of the colony, Captain Hunter, having
been appointed Governor in succession to Captain
Phillip, arrived in Port Jackson with the <i>Reliance</i>
and the <i>Supply</i>, bringing George Bass as surgeon and
Matthew Flinders in the capacity of midshipman.
These adventurous and truly kindred spirits lost no
time in girding themselves up for the work of
discovery. They had been barely a month in the
country when the colonists saw them start on their first
expedition. Taking only a boy for general service,
and embarking in a boat not more than eight feet
long&mdash;very suitably named the <i>Tom Thumb</i>&mdash;they
sailed round to Botany Bay, thence up George's River,
which was now explored for 20 miles beyond what was
previously known. The results were, the opening up
of much available land and the commencement of a
new settlement under the name of Bankstown, which
is still retained. But the success attending this
adventure was eclipsed by next year's discoveries, which
were achieved under similar difficulties. The tiny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<i>Tom Thumb</i>, with its crew of three all told, again left
Port Jackson for the purpose of examining a large
river which was supposed to enter the ocean to the
south of Botany Bay. Having stood out to sea in
order to catch the current, the voyagers unwittingly
passed the object of their search and were carried far
southward. Bad weather now supervened; the little
craft was tossed like a cork on the billows, and
finally beached in a heavy surf with the loss of many
valuables on board. Being now in want of water, the
party were compelled to leave the rock-bound coast
and steer still further south, in the hope of finding a
more favourable locality. Eventually they cast
anchor about two miles beyond the present town of
Wollongong, in an inlet which, in commemoration of
this incident, still bears the name of the Tom Thumb
Lagoon. The blacks, it was ascertained, called the
district Allourie, which has, doubtless, been transformed
into the more euphonious Illawarra. On the
homeward voyage Bass and Flinders made a seasonable
discovery of a snug little shelter, which they
called Providential Cove, but which is now generally
known by the native name, Wattamolla. About four
miles further north they were fortunate at last in
hitting upon the real object of their search. It proved
to be a large sheet of water stretching several miles
inland, and presented the appearance of a port rather
than a river. The natives spoke of it as "Deeban,"
but it is now called Port Hacking, it is believed in
acknowledgment of the services of a pilot of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 8]</a></span>
name. Having accomplished far more than the object
they had in view, the daring seamen returned to
Sydney Cove, after passing through a succession of
perils and privations which give to their narrative the
character, not of sober history, but of wild romance.</p>

<p>The next important expedition was carried out
under the sole conduct of Bass. On his own petition
the Governor furnished him with a whale-boat,
carrying a crew of six seamen and provided with
supplies for six weeks only. With so slender an
equipment this born adventurer sailed from Port
Jackson on a voyage of 600 miles, along a little-known
and possibly perilous coast. One lovely
summer evening, which happened to be the 3rd of
December, 1797, the little whaler with its stout-hearted
crew bore round the South Head, and bravely
turned its prow towards its unknown destination.
Scarcely had the familiar landmarks dropped out of
sight when the elements engaged in tempestuous fury,
and the storm drove the adventurers to seek shelter
first at Port Hacking, next at Wattamolla, and again
near Cook's Red Point, on the Illawarra coast. The
headland, under the lee of which the vessel took
refuge, stands a little to the south of Lake Illawarra,
and still bears the name of Bass' Point. Not long
after the voyage was resumed he discovered the
embouchure of a river in an inferior harbour, which he
called Shoalhaven, believing it deserved no better
name. Jervis Bay was next entered, but this was no
discovery, for it had been previously explored by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Lieutenant Bowen, whose name is still preserved in
an island lying near the entrance. Bass, however,
had the good luck to discover Twofold Bay&mdash;a scene
of never-failing beauty, and a place of importance in
our early history. Passing rapidly southward he
rounded Cape Howe, and first noticed the Long
Beach, but was unable to identify Point Hicks. He
was now 300 miles from Sydney, and whatever
remained of the voyage was along an absolutely
unknown coast. Some important discoveries were
made at various points, but the most valuable portion
of his labours was the exploration of Western Port.
Here he remained thirteen days, during which this
commodious harbour was carefully examined and
fully described. A leading object of the voyage had
been to settle the question of the suspected insularity
of Van Diemen's Land. Bass had really solved the
problem without knowing it, for he had passed
through the strait which now bears his name. That
it was detached from the continent his own bearings
rendered almost a certainty. To do more was impossible
in the circumstances. He had already been
seven weeks from Sydney, which had been left with
only six weeks' provisions. These, though eked out
by an occasional supply of fish and fowl, were nearly
exhausted, and the homeward voyage was made on
the shortest course. During an absence of eleven
weeks he had examined the coast for 600 miles south
of Port Jackson, the latter half of which had been
utterly unknown up to the time of this expedition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 10]</a></span>
</p>

<p>There still remains for review another memorable
voyage of discovery, undertaken by Bass and Flinders
conjointly in the year 1798. The object of this
expedition was to demonstrate the existence of the
probable strait and the consequent insularity of
Van Diemen's land; and the way it was proposed to
accomplish this double object was to sail through the
channel and circumnavigate the island. Bent on this
adventure Bass and Flinders left Sydney Cove on the
7th October, in the <i>Norfolk</i>, a good sea-going sloop of
25 tons burthen. The run over the known waters was
made purposely in haste, because the time was limited.
Their cruise in the channel disclosed a large number
of islands, the haunts of myriads of sea-fowl,
particularly the sooty petrel, which, though far from
savoury, served as an article of food. This strange
bird was found, like the rabbit, to burrow in the
ground, where it was easily captured in the evening.
Flinders says it was simply necessary to thrust in the
whole length of the arm into the hole, whence one
would be almost certain to bring out a petrel&mdash;or a
snake. The alternative was not a pleasant one, but
the commander had to husband up the provisions and
the sailors were not unwilling to run the risk. The
circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania)
commenced at the northern point, known as Cape
Portland. Nothing specially remarkable occurred till
a point was reached which they named Low Head,
immediately after which the <i>Norfolk</i> entered an arm
of the sea more than a mile in width. This appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to be a discovery of sufficient importance to devote
sixteen days to its exploration. It proved to be the
embouchure of what is now known as the River
Tamar, on which Launceston, the second town of the
island, is built. The discoverers sailed up the estuary,
following its course for many miles inland. It was
found to be alive with aquatic fowls, particularly
black swans, sometimes numbering 500 in a flock.
This unexpected diversion proved rich sport, and
afforded a pleasant interlude to the monotony of life
at sea. But the expedition was not for play, but
work, and the ship was again upon her course. After
a short sail to the westward they found themselves
rounding the north-west cape, and with glad hearts
could perceive the shore trending away for many a
league to the south. The problem was already
virtually solved. "Mr. Bass and myself," says
Flinders, "hailed it with joy and mutual congratulation,
as announcing the completion of our long-wished-for
discovery of a passage into the southern
Indian Ocean." This fortunate issue of their labours
marked an epoch both in the history of discovery and
the progress of international commerce. The circuitous
route round the south of Van Diemen's Land
could henceforth be avoided, and in our day the
intervening strait has become the ordinary highway
for the Australian trade. It being still deemed
advisable to carry out the instructions to the letter,
the circumnavigation of the island was prosecuted
with varying interest. In the southern parts some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 12]</a></span>
valuable discoveries were made, and errors of previous
observers corrected. In consequence of unfavourable
weather the run along the eastern coast was made for
the most part out of sight of land, but on the 6th of
January it was found they had completely rounded
Van Diemen's Land, and so brought their work to an
end. The time allotted for the expedition having also
expired, the heroic navigators returned to Sydney,
bringing the welcome intelligence that doubt was no
longer possible concerning the insularity of Tasmania,
and the practicability of the intervening channel as
a highway of commerce. The merit of this latter
discovery is almost equally due to both navigators,
but with a generosity which reflects credit, and is as
noble as it is rare, Flinders prevailed on Governor
Hunter to call it Bass' Strait.</p>

<p>What had now been done for the island of Van
Diemen's Land by Bass and Flinders conjointly was
next to be achieved for the continent of Australia by
Flinders single-handed. Before his time much had
been done in enterprises of discovery on numerous
and distant parts of the coast by various commanders
and by different nations; but as these efforts had been
conducted under no comprehensive plan, there was no
continuous line of exploration, and accordingly the
discoveries hitherto made were known only as <i>disjecta
membra</i>, lying at wide intervals in the Southern
Ocean; but whether they were the extremities of one
and the same continent, or a cluster of sporadic
islands, there was not yet sufficient evidence to show.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 13]</a></span>
To settle this question was the true mission of
Matthew Flinders, and the method he adopted was to
circumnavigate the whole territory, keeping so near
the land as to have his eye on the raging surf, except
when the darkness of the night and the wildness of
the weather rendered this purpose impracticable. On
the very day of his death the printing-press issued a
record of his labours in a couple of goodly quartos
entitled "A Voyage to Terra Australis." This name
was proposed for the new country as a fair and likely
means of overcoming an acknowledged difficulty. The
Dutch had long ago discovered the western coast and
called the country New Holland, whereas the English,
having performed a similar service for the eastern
side, gave the name of New South Wales to this and
the parts adjacent. Herein lay the difficulty; to call
the whole continent New Holland seemed unfair to
the English, whilst it appeared equally unjust to the
Dutch to give the entire country the name of New
South Wales. Flinders thought Terra Australis
would be a reasonable compromise, but added, in an
all-important footnote&mdash;"Had I permitted myself any
innovation upon the original term, it would have been
to convert it into AUSTRALIA, as being more agreeable
to the ear and an assimilation to the other great
portions of the earth." The suggestion was a most
fortunate one, in spite of the innovation, and the
remark shows that, among other and greater obligations,
we are indebted to this navigator for the name
of our country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 14]</a></span>
</p>

<p>On the 18th of July, 1801, Flinders sailed from
Spithead in the <i>Investigator</i> for the circumnavigation
of Australia. The continent was first sighted on the
6th of December at the old landmark of the Leeuwin,
which had hitherto been believed to be an island, but
was now found to be connected with the mainland,
and henceforth known as <i>Cape</i> Leeuwin. Having
visited King George's Sound, the run was next made
along the Great Australian Bight to Fowler's Bay and
Nuyt's Archipelago. Other navigators had visited
this part and examined it with more or less attention.
All the knowledge gained in the next stage had the
merit of original discoveries. Foremost among these
were Spencer and St. Vincent Gulfs, with Yorke
Peninsula intervening, and a large island lying nearly
opposite. On the latter they found no human inhabitants,
but marsupials and seals were seen in
prodigious numbers, and hence the explorers gave it
the name of Kangaroo Island. Having never met
with any of Adam's children till now, the denizens of
the island showed no timidity in the presence of the
strangers, nor expected any harm; and this indifference
was observed to continue much longer with the
kangaroos than with the seals. Flinders was of
opinion that the kangaroos mistook their visitors
for a variety of seals, but the seals soon became too
knowing to confound them with kangaroos. A little
sharp experience led both classes of animals to regard
the intruders as deadly enemies. From that hour
confidence departed and fear took its place. Shortly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 15]</a></span>
after the navigator left this island a very memorable
incident occurred. A sailor from the mast-head
reported a white rock in sight. On a nearer view it
proved to be the sails of a ship&mdash;of all things surely
the last to be expected in this unknown quarter of the
world. Both vessels met in these strange waters, and
then the apparition turned out to be the French ship
the <i>Geographe</i>, also on a voyage of discovery, under the
command of Captain Baudin. The jealous Frenchman
ill concealed his vexation on meeting with a rival who
had reaped the harvest of discovery over so many
leagues of a coast-line which he believed himself to be
the first to visit. Nor was jealousy his only or his
worst fault. This unscrupulous navigator had the
audacity to proceed as an explorer in unknown
waters, and lay claim to discoveries which the
Englishman had just made. Flinders, on the contrary,
acted like the model of integrity which he was. He
maintained the right of prior discovery in respect to
all the places he had been the first to visit, leaving to
Baudin an undisputed claim on such as he had already
examined. This is the reason why the names of localities
to the westward of this point are predominantly
English, while those lying to the east are French. To the
place of meeting, as being a sort of double discovery,
Flinders gave the name of Encounter Bay. A minute
examination of the remaining portions of this coast
having been rendered unnecessary, in consequence of
Baudin's cruise, Flinders now pushed on to Bass'
Strait and entered an inlet which he supposed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Western Port. This conjecture turned out to be a
mistake, for the place, so far as Flinders was concerned,
proved to be a new discovery. Subsequently,
however, he ascertained that the inlet had been visited
about ten weeks earlier by Lieutenant Murray, who
had given it the name of Port Phillip. Perceiving
the importance of the place, Flinders wisely devoted
one week to the examination of the bay and the
exploration of the immediate neighbourhood. Having
seen so many capabilities of land and water, he put
on record his opinion that "a settlement would
probably be made at Port Phillip some time after."
This hesitating prophecy was uttered as late as the year
1802, and the locality in question is the site on which
the great city of Melbourne now stands, with its
population of 300,000 souls! Having again stood out
to sea, the <i>Investigator</i> was soon abreast of Western
Port, the utmost limit of Bass's discoveries, and now
the vessel was considered to be in known waters. A
direct run was accordingly made for Port Jackson,
and Sydney was reached on the 1st of May, 1802.</p>

<p>Philip Gidley King was at that time governor of
New South Wales, and Flinders had the good fortune
to find in him both the courtesy of a gentleman and
the kindness of a friend. Permission having been
obtained from the Admiralty, the Governor placed the
<i>Lady Nelson</i> at the service of the indefatigable navigator,
and in every possible way encouraged his
enterprise. Being thus supplied with all requisites
which the young settlement could furnish, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<i>Investigator</i>, accompanied by the <i>Lady Nelson</i> as
tender, resumed the voyage of circumnavigation
under promising auspices. Since the time of Cook
the north-eastern coast had been visited in various
parts by different navigators, but much yet remained
to be done before a correct map could be drawn up,
and Flinders had it among his instructions to supply
the deficiencies of his predecessors wherever that
might be possible. Having taken the trouble to find
out what portions of the coast Cook had passed in the
night, he made it his business to keep a sharp look-out
on such localities, and in this way became the
discoverer of Curtis Bay and other inlets of considerable
importance. He was able also to correct many
of Cook's observations, and being provided with
better instruments, supplied, in not a few cases, the
shortcomings of several other predecessors. But his
most valuable services in this quarter were his
observations on the Great Barrier Reef, which for
more than a thousand miles runs nearly parallel with
the northern coast, and had hitherto been viewed as
the terror of navigators. To pierce this obstruction
and get out into the open sea was an undertaking of
so much intricacy that seamen were accustomed to
call it "threading the needle." Even Cook, prince of
navigators as he was, failed in the attempt. Flinders
persevered till he discovered a safe gap in the mighty
rampart, and showed succeeding navigators an easy
escape from a grave difficulty. An outside course
was then followed to the extreme north. Having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 18]</a></span>
now passed through the Endeavour Strait, Flinders
came to anchor in the Gulf of Carpentaria, where he
found a new scene for his energies and a rich field of
discovery awaiting him.</p>

<p>The Gulf of Carpentaria had been early visited by
the Dutch navigators, but its exploration&mdash;if this word
could be applied at all&mdash;had been conducted in a
desultory and piecemeal fashion. Its turn had come
at last, and the same painstaking service was to be
rendered here which had made the south and eastern
coasts so correctly known. Flinders found the gulf
defined on the chart by a vague and hesitating coast-line,
which turned out, in most cases, to be more
imaginary than according to nature, and he left it so
accurately described that his successors have been
able to add little to his careful investigations. In this
patient research four months were consumed, during
which period he examined the whole coast from end
to end, including Arnheim Bay. The three seaboards
of Australia, south, east, and north, had now
been explored in the <i>Investigator</i>. It need not,
therefore, occasion surprise to hear of her showing
signs of decay. This matter had to be attended to
before commencing the survey of the western coast,
which was meant to be as thorough as that of the
other three had been. After making a call at Timor
with despatches, a rapid run was made for Port
Jackson by the western coast, but out of sight of
land. Cape Leeuwin, the point from which the circumnavigation
had started, was reached on the 13th of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 19]</a></span>
May, 1803, and thus the heroic undertaking was
virtually accomplished. Shipwreck, tragic sufferings,
and diabolical treachery cut off the possibility of any
further exploration of the western coast by Matthew
Flinders.</p>

<p>The work which was thus left imperfect through a
long series of misfortunes was afterwards resumed,
and very satisfactorily completed, by another distinguished
navigator, Captain, and subsequently Admiral
King. He played a prominent part in this
period of our history, and was much beloved for his
sterling qualities both of head and heart. He made
four voyages to the western coast, in every one of
which excellent service was rendered to the cause of
exploration. The following interesting abstract of his
discoveries has been kindly furnished by his son, the
Hon. P. G. King, M.L.C.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the 4th of February, 1817, Lieutenant Philip
Parker King, of the Royal Navy, the only son of
Captain Philip Gidley King, the third Governor of
New South Wales, was appointed by the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty to carry out a survey of
the then unexplored parts of the 'coasts of New
South Wales,' which comprised from Arnheim Bay,
near the western entrance of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
westward, and southward as far as the South-West
Cape, including the opening or deep bay called Van
Diemen's Bay, and the cluster of islands called the
Rosemary Islands, and the inlets behind them. He
was also to examine the coast between Cape Leeuwin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and Cape Gasselin in M. De Freycinet's chart, and to
complete the circumnavigation of the 'continent.'</p>

<p>"The Governor of the colony was directed to
place at his disposal any suitable vessel for his
purpose, and accordingly the <i>Mermaid</i>, a cutter
recently arrived from India, of 84 tons burden, was
placed under his charge. Mr. F. Bedwell and Mr.
John Septimus Roe (afterwards Surveyor-General of
Western Australia) were his assistants, and Mr. Allan
Cunningham, the botanical collector, specially appointed
by Sir Joseph Banks, the botanist of Cook's
expedition. The chief of the Broken Bay tribe of
aborigines, 'Boon-ga-ree,' accompanied the little expedition,
and much service was obtained from him in
the various interviews with the natives.</p>

<p>"Taking advantage of the westerly monsoon, the
<i>Mermaid</i> commenced her work, leaving Port Jackson
on the 22nd of December, 1817, and, proceeding by
Bass' Strait, arrived off the North-West Cape on
the 10th of February. The favourable wind lasted
till the beginning of March, when the south-east
monsoon obliged the vessel to be worked to the
eastward, for the purpose of running before it on her
work. Having examined the coast and islands as far
as Depuch Bay, the survey was resumed at the
Goulburn Islands. Port Essington was examined;
also, Van Diemen's Gulf and the Alligator River. A
survey was made of the northern shore of Melville
Island and Apsley Strait, till the 31st of May, when,
provisions drawing to an end and water failing, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 21]</a></span>
little vessel stretched across 'the Great Australian
Strait' to Timor, and anchored off the Dutch settlement
of Coepang on the 4th of June. On the 19th
Montebelle and Barrow Islands were surveyed.
Dysentery now attacked the ship's company, and
further work had to be given up for this, Lieutenant
King's first voyage, which, lasting 31-1/2 weeks, terminated
in his return to Port Jackson on the 29th
of July.</p>

<p>"The winds not proving favourable for the passage
through Torres Strait by the eastern coast till
February in the following year, 1819, a voyage was
made in the interval to Van Diemen's Land, and a
survey was made of Macquarie Harbour, on the west
coast, and a departure was taken for the second
voyage on the 8th of May, during which a running
survey was made, including an examination of the
entrance of Port Macquarie, from the entrance of the
inner passage through the Barrier Reefs at Breaksea
Spit to the Endeavour River, thence northerly as far
as Cape York. A stretch was now made across the
Gulf of Carpentaria, and various parts of the coast to
the westward were examined, and Cambridge Gulf
and Admiralty Gulf were discovered and surveyed.
A second visit had to be made to Coepang to obtain
supplies, to enable the vessel to return to Port
Jackson, where they arrived on the 12th December,
after an absence of 35 weeks. During this voyage
a survey had been made of 540 miles of the
northern coast, in addition to 500 on the previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 22]</a></span>
expedition, as well as on this occasion making a
running survey on the eastern coast of 900 miles.</p>

<p>"The third expedition comprised a further survey
of the 900 miles just alluded to, and of the north-west
coast in various parts. It may be noteworthy that
the cutter was rigged on this occasion with rope made
in New South Wales from New Zealand flax (<i>phormium
tenax</i>). The third voyage was completed on
the 9th of December, 1820, having occupied a period
of 25-1/2 weeks.</p>

<p>"For the fourth voyage it was found necessary to
purchase a larger vessel, and, accordingly, Captain
King, who had now received his promotion, found
himself in command of a brig of 170 tons, which was
thereafter called the <i>Bathurst</i>. The coast northwards
to Torres Strait was further examined. The
Mauritius was visited, and the west coast examined
from Rottnest Island to the Buccaneers' Archipelago.
The <i>Bathurst</i> returned to Port Jackson on the 25th
of April, 1822, after an absence of 344 days. Captain
King was then ordered by the Admiralty to return
to England, to prepare his charts and journals for
publication.</p>

<p>"It is impossible in such a short <i>r√©sum√©</i> of his
voyages to allude to the numerous and interesting
interviews with the aborigines which he fell in with,
further than to state that they were always conducted
with a desire to establish friendly relations.
Captain King's services were approved by the
Admiralty, as he was entrusted with another command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of two vessels, to survey the southern coasts of
South America."</p>

<p>From 1839 to 1845 the survey of the north-western
coasts was continued with the <i>Beagle</i>, first under the
command of Captain Wickham, and subsequently of
Lieutenant Stokes. Soon after arriving from England,
in the close of 1837, the coast was examined
from Roebuck Bay to King's Sound, during which
cruise the Fitzroy River was discovered and navigated
for 90 miles from its entrance. In another
voyage to the north the coast was explored in the
vicinity of Port Essington, which was found to be a
spacious harbour. Whilst examining Clarence Strait
they made the important discovery of the Adelaide
River, which was subsequently described by Mr. J.
M'Douall Stuart as one of the best possible situations
for a new settlement. Port Darwin was also discovered
during this voyage. The <i>Beagle</i> now proceeded to
Cambridge Gulf, and discovered the Victoria and
Fitzmaurice Rivers. The former was navigated for
50 miles, and rather hastily described as one of the
finest rivers of Australia. The run was now made to
Swan River, and thence, after a cruise among the
islands, to Port Jackson. In June, 1841, the <i>Beagle</i>
again left Sydney, to examine the southern coast of
the Gulf of Carpentaria. Some important discoveries
were made during this cruise. A fine river, which the
explorers named the Flinders, was found, and navigated
for 30 miles. On the 1st of August they
discovered the Albert. Having ascended to a splendid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 24]</a></span>
sheet of water, which was named Hope Reach, they
found themselves in the midst of enchanting scenery,
which Captain Stokes thus describes:&mdash;"It was as
glorious a prospect as could greet the eye. A magnificent
sheet of water lay before us in one unbroken
expanse, resembling a smooth translucent lake. Its
gentle repose harmonized exquisitely with the slender,
motionless boughs of the drooping gums, palms, and
acacias that clustered on the banks, and dipped their
feathery foliage in the limpid stream that, like a
polished mirror, bore within its bosom the image of the
graceful vegetation by which it was bordered. The
report of our guns, as they dealt destruction among
the quails that here abounded, rolled for the first
time along the waters of the Albert, breaking in on
the hush of stillness that appeared to reign over all
like the presence of a spirit. The country which
stretched away from either bank was an extensive
plain, covered with long, coarse grass, above which was
occasionally seen the head of a kangaroo, listening
with its acute ear to our approach." It was not
possible to ascend much higher than this reach, on
account of the fallen timber which blocked the
channel. The explorers then landed on immense
plains, which, perhaps with too hasty judgment, they
named the Plains of Promise. During this voyage
they had examined the Gulf coast for 200 miles,
making the discovery of twenty inlets and two large
rivers.</p>

<h3>THE PIONEERS OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.</h3>


<p>Persons who have yet to make their acquaintance
with the early history of New South Wales will learn
with surprise that the colony had been founded for
almost a quarter of a century before the Blue Mountain
barrier was crossed. For so long a period it was
scarcely possible to proceed more than forty miles
from Sydney in any direction. Many a despairing
look must those early settlers have cast on the
frowning ramparts of the range, which, leaving only a
narrow margin between itself and the sea, threatened
to convert the cradle of the colony into a Procrustes'
bed, to which its dimensions would have to conform in
the future, as they had done in the past. This sense
of confinement was the harder to bear that it was met
with in a land of freedom; and many a time did the
caged eagle dash itself with fruitless rage against the
bars of its prison. A record of the unsuccessful
attempts to get beyond the main range would form a
heroic chapter of our history, and one, too, of which
we might well feel proud, if there is any truth in the
saying that in great undertakings it is glorious even
to fail. Within four months after the arrival of the
"first fleet" our annals present a picture of Governor
Phillip and party struggling laboriously westward to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the gorges of the mountains. In 1793 Lieutenant
Dawes, with Captains Trench and Paterson, put forth
equally persistent, but just as unsuccessful, efforts to
scale the sandstone cliffs and reach the interior.
During this year, also, H. Hacking, of the <i>Sirius</i>,
with two companions, penetrated twenty miles into
the mountains, passing over eighteen or nineteen
ridges or gullies, and returned to the settlement after
an absence of seven days. Three years later George
Bass, the famous, though unprofessional, navigator
and discoverer of the strait which still bears his
name, did all that marvels of perseverance could
accomplish in the hope of forcing a passage by way
of the valley of the Grose. Taking a party on
whose courage he could rely, Bass had his feet armed
with iron hooks that he might scale the cliffs, after the
manner of a spider, and made his men lower him with
ropes into the outlying chasms. But it was all in
vain. After fifteen days of heroic endeavour, he
returned to Sydney, bringing the cold comfort of
impossibility of transit. Bass assured his fellow-colonists
that a passage over the Blue Mountains did
not exist, even for a person on foot. It is possible
that this strong statement was disproved almost
immediately after. A tradition, not too well authenticated,
speaks of a convict of the name of Wilson
actually crossing the mountains in 1799. With
another advance we get better footing, and read of a
Lieutenant Barrellier making a similar attempt, but
only to add another name to the list of failures. Two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 27]</a></span>
years later an effort of a more promising character
was made by a botanist of the name of Cayley, who
pushed his way into the heart of the mountains as far
as the present Numantia, where he erected a cairn of
stones to mark the furthest limit of exploration to
the west. He left his rude monument without a name,
but Governor Macquarie, in a sportive mood, called it
"Cayley's Repulse," and by this brand it is still remembered
by old colonists. The late Dr. Lang thus refers
to it in his "History":&mdash;"The place was pointed out to
me by a respectable settler of the Bathurst district on
crossing the mountains for the first time in the year
1826. It is certainly a most remarkable locality,
nothing being visible in any direction but immense
masses of weather-beaten sandstone rocks, towering
over each other in all the sublimity of desolation;
quite a deep chasm, intersecting a lofty ridge covered
with blasted trees, seems to present an insurmountable
barrier to all further progress."</p>

<p>At this outpost discovery appears to have stood still
for a considerable period. If further attempts were
entered on in the succeeding years very little has been
said about them. The settlers must have made up
their minds for the time being to submit to the
inevitable and reconcile themselves to the situation
with the best consolation they could find. But a
pressing emergency assailed them before long which
aroused the slumbering energy and led to another
assault on the western ramparts. A continuous
drought had succeeded equally disastrous floods in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the Hawkesbury. The live stock of the settlement
had by this time increased to 65,121 sheep, 21,343
horned cattle, and 1,891 horses, and all these had to
be kept during a season of drought on an area of
80 miles by 40, the greater part of which in the
best of times was hopelessly sterile. In this trying
situation it became very manifest that one of two
alternatives had to be faced&mdash;either the Blue Mountain
barrier must be forced at all hazards and a way
found into the interior, or, should this prove to be
absolutely impossible, the surplus stock would have
to be removed from the colony, if they were not to
perish from starvation. The crisis was a serious one,
but it happily called forth an effectual remedy. Three
most capable men now came to the front to scale the
mountain ramparts from which so many assailants
had already been cast down; and now, at last, fortune
was pleased to smile on the enterprise. The foremost
of this memorable trio was Gregory Blaxland, a
native of Kent, and born of an old English family in
1779. The second on the expedition was William
Lawson, who was formerly lieutenant in the 102nd
regiment, but had latterly retired to "Veteran Hall,"
his own country seat near Prospect. These two
leaders, on whom the whole responsibility devolved,
were joined by a third person, then wholly unknown,
but who afterwards made for himself a name not to
be forgotten in New South Wales. This was the
embryo patriot and statesman, William Charles
Wentworth. Blaxland was now in his 35th year,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Lawson about the same age, but Wentworth was
barely out of his 'teens, and professedly joined the
expedition in a freak of youthful adventure.</p>

<p>This memorable expedition, consisting of the three
parties named, together with four attendants, a few
pack horses, and several hunting dogs, left Blaxland's
farm, at South Creek, on the 11th of May, 1813.
The same afternoon the Nepean was crossed at Emu
Ford, and the first encampment made the same evening
at the foot of the mountains which had so long
marked the western boundary of the settlement.
The plan they resolved to follow was to adhere to
the dividing ridge or watershed between the Warragumby
and Grose Rivers, being careful to head all
the tributaries departing to the right or to the left.
This determination proved the secret of their ultimate
success, and put the explorers in possession of the
only key to the situation. Next morning the Emu
Plains were left behind and the ascent of the
mountains commenced. The high land of Grose Head
is noted as being about seven miles to the north-east,
and the place where the ascent began must have
been considerably to the north of the present Zig-zag,
and near the starting point of the original Bathurst-road.
Having scaled the steepest part of the ridge,
here about 800 feet high, the travellers were careful
to head all the watercourses on both sides, in the hope
of finding that the highest ground would also be
continuous. The first day's progress amounted to a
little over three miles, generally in a south-western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 30]</a></span>
direction, and the night's encampment was made at
the head of a deep gully, where a small supply of
water was found in the rock. Next morning a start
was made about 9 o'clock. After proceeding about a
mile they had the good luck to hit upon a large
tract of forest land. Here was discovered the track
of a European, who had marked the trees. This belt
of open country ceased about two miles ahead, at
which point further progress was obstructed by
impenetrable brushwood. The remainder of the day
having been consumed in fruitless efforts to round
this obstacle, the night was spent in the former
position. Next morning the axes were early at work
hewing a track through the scrub, which could
neither be avoided nor penetrated. This step-by-step
progress had to be endured for five miles, until a
more open patch was reached. Nor was this an
exceptional case. A great part of the route over the
mountains had in like manner to be laid open by the
axe, thus making it necessary to travel three times
over the same ground. First, the track had to be cut
out; next, they had to return for the horses; and
then the real advance was made for another stage.
On the fifth day the brushwood proved so formidable
that their progress did not exceed two miles. The
following day was Sunday, and the explorers enjoyed
the Sabbath rest as much as any toil-worn slave that
ever breathed. On the 17th the horses were loaded
with a supply of grass, as the country was becoming
still more inhospitable, and an advance of seven miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 31]</a></span>
was made through a track which the axe had laid
open. But the windings of the watershed now
appeared interminable, and the real progress, if
measured in a straight line, was small indeed. Yet it
was only by this tedious course that the mountains
could be crossed, if crossed at all. The locality of the
next encampment was destitute of water, and what
could be obtained in the vicinity had to be carried up
a precipitous cliff 600 feet in height. The horses had
to shift as they best could for that evening. To
aggravate matters, if such a thing were possible, a
more serious obstacle now rose in front of the intrepid
explorers. The ridge, which was their only
hope, contracted to a width of 20 feet, and appeared
to terminate in a huge rock rising 30 feet directly in
front. But perseverance, which overcomes all things,
brought them safely over this barrier too. Wednesday,
the 19th, was a red-letter day, for they now
reached the summit of the second elevation of the
main range. The site also was suitable for a camp,
and offered a good supply of grass and water. Next
day a five-mile stage was accomplished, and the camp
formed on the margin of a lagoon with a small stream
of water running through it. Here the horses were
left till the men had cut another day's march through
the scrub. Soon after the ridge began to widen, but
proved to be more rocky than ever. From the 22nd
to the 28th the advance was made at much the same
rate and without any incidents calling for particular
remark. At last the pioneers had the inexpressible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 32]</a></span>
satisfaction of finding themselves on the western fall
of the mountains. But the slopes facing the interior
were exceedingly rugged, and a practicable descent
was nearly despaired of. After much difficulty a
barely feasible one was discovered, by means of
which the party got clear of the mountains and
found themselves in a lovely valley, afterwards
called the Yale of Clwydd, and now well known as
the site of the town of Hartley.</p>

<p>Now, at last, the Blue Mountains had been crossed,
but the pioneers continued their journey a short
distance further, to make sure that every obstacle
had been overcome. After leaving the range they
advanced two miles to the westward on the same day,
and encamped on the bank of a fine stream, probably
what was afterwards known as the Rivulet, and now,
by an absurd blunder in spelling, the River Lett.
The last encampment was made on another brook,
since called Farmer's Creek, but not from any connection
with the farming interest. Here Sir Thomas
Mitchell lost his favourite horse "Farmer," and
considered the event of sufficient importance to have
its remembrance preserved in the name of the creek.
From this outpost of the expedition Blaxland went
forth on the last afternoon of May, 1813, and ascended
a neighbouring hill, from the top of which he beheld a
magnificent expanse of pastoral country, sufficient, in
his reckoning, to meet the wants of the colony for
thirty years to come. This being the extreme point
reached in this enterprise, Governor Macquarie paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the leader a well-merited compliment in associating
the name of Blaxland with this memorable peak.</p>

<p>The object of the journey being now happily
attained, it was judged unnecessary to travel further.
Twenty days had been spent in forcing a passage
through the formidable mountain barrier, and the
progress had been so slow that not much more than
three miles per day had been averaged. The actual
distance travelled along this tortuous ridge was
reckoned at fifty miles, and eight more had been
added on the other side. The return journey calls for
no detailed remarks. The explorers were greatly
fatigued, in very poor health, and their clothes had
been torn to rags. Their outward track had been
too laboriously hewn through the brushwood to be
difficult to find on their return. The colonists at
Sydney hailed with welcome the tidings of this signal
success, and lost no time in turning the wished-for
discovery to practical account.</p>

<h3>SURVEYOR EVANS'S DISCOVERY OF THE LACHLAN AND
MACQUARIE RIVERS AND THE BATHURST PLAINS.</h3>


<p>Delighted with the success which had rewarded the
Blue Mountain enterprise, Governor Macquarie took
prompt action in following up this conquest over
nature's barrier. A new and very capable man was
now ready to enter the field. This was Mr. George
W. Evans, who at that time filled the office of
Deputy-Surveyor. His name occupies an honourable
place in our early annals. It were to be wished
we had fuller particulars of this first effort of his in
the exploration of the colony than are now to hand.
The following brief sketch embodies all that is really
known on this subject:&mdash;He was absent only seven
weeks on his first journey, and in 21 days had
penetrated 98 miles beyond the most advanced camp
of his predecessors. This new explorer crossed the
Nepean at Emu Ford on the 20th of November, 1813,
and, six days after, arrived at the termination of the
journey of the Blue Mountain pioneers. Proceeding
westward, he crossed a well-grassed but broken and
rugged country, which was subsequently called the
Clarence Hilly Range. By the 30th he had reached
the dividing ridge which forms the watershed between
the eastern and western streams. Soon after
this he discovered, in a well-grassed valley, the head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 35]</a></span>
waters of a stream that abounded in fish, and hence
received the name of the Fish River. He continued
to trace it, winding its course through a fine country,
suitable for agricultural and grazing purposes, till the
7th of December, when it was joined by another
stream, which he named the Campbell. To the river
which was thus formed by these tributaries he gave
the name of the Macquarie, after the Governor, but
the natives called it the Wambool. Continuing on
the lead of the Macquarie, he followed it through rich
alluvial land&mdash;the Bathurst Plains&mdash;destitute of
timber, but abounding in game. During the whole
journey Evans met with only six natives, but saw the
smoke of their encampments in many places. He
returned to Sydney on the 8th of January, 1814.
After a short interval he was again sent out to the
same district, with a small party and one month's
provisions. During this second journey Limestone
Creek was discovered and explored; but its chief
result was the discovery of another large river, which
he called the Lachlan, after the Christian name of the
Governor. The Lachlan and the Macquarie formed
an enigma to the early geographers. Their sources
were in the same neighbourhood, but both flowed
towards the interior and kept diverging from one
another during every mile of their known course.</p>

<p>The proper sequel to Evans's discoveries was the
formation of a road over the mountains to Bathurst
Plains. This was done in the same year by gangs of
convicts under the command of one Cox, in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 36]</a></span>
incredibly short space of time, as tradition reports.
This road, 100 miles in length, was formally opened
in May, 1815, by the Governor and Mrs. Macquarie,
who rode the whole distance on horseback. Bathurst
was then laid out, and has ever since continued to be
one of the most flourishing places in the colony, as
might well be expected from a town which commands
50,000 acres of first-class land within a radius of ten
miles.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>OXLEY'S EXPEDITIONS TO THE LACHLAN AND
MACQUARIE RIVERS.</h3>


<p>The passion for exploration was not yet allowed to
slumber. Deputy-Surveyor Evans's discovery of the
Bathurst Plains, with two promising rivers, only
whetted the desire for further knowledge. It was
presumed that the Lachlan and the Macquarie united
their waters in some part of their course and finally
disembogued in an unknown part of the eastern
coast. But all this was mere conjecture, which
required to be cleared up by actual exploration. A
new expedition was accordingly set on foot by the
Governor, and a fit person appointed to the post
of leader. This was the Surveyor-General, John
Oxley, R.N., who appears to have been both an able
and amiable man, combining the <i>fortiter in re</i> with
the <i>suaviter in modo</i>. Allan Cunningham, who
was his close associate, always spoke of Oxley in
terms of admiration and endearment. Among other
meritorious services he had the credit of giving to
New South Wales the first map of her immense
territories, a task for which he was well qualified by
extensive colonial travel in his official capacity.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>This expedition, as finally organized under the
conduct of Oxley, consisted of Allan Cunningham, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 38]</a></span>
king's botanist, Charles Frazer, as colonial botanist,
William Parr, as mineralogist, and eight others. On
the 20th of April, 1817, all the members of the
expedition met at a store dep√¥t on the bank of the
Lachlan River, which had been fixed as the point of
departure. The details of their weary wanderings
have been recorded only at too great length in
Oxley's published journals. The author in the commencement
of his work apologized for the uneventful
character of the narrative, and if this was necessary
when enthusiasm for exploration was at fever heat,
the reader of the present day is not likely to consider
it superfluous. The fault, however, did not lie with
the writer, but is to be attributed to the uninteresting
materials which form the staple of his
bulky volumes. The country he had to traverse soon
turned out to be singularly tame and tedious. The
sea coast, with its never-ending scenes of beauty, had
been left far behind; the mountain ranges, with
their vast and varied grandeur, had sunk below the
horizon, and in place of both were found only the
dull and dreary plains of the Australian bush. Were
it not that the whole of the country was new, this
record of daily travel would read like the diary of a
conscientious but uneventful life. It will be desirable,
therefore, to touch only on the chief points of the
narrative.</p>

<p>Starting from the point previously indicated, the
party proceeded on their travels along the southern
bank of the river. Wild fowl appeared in large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 39]</a></span>
numbers, offering excellent sport. The natives also
were met with more frequently than would have been
agreeable had they been disposed to be troublesome,
which, fortunately, they were not. The one thing
which surprised the explorers was the behaviour
of the Lachlan, which, after showing itself a goodly
river of a hundred feet in width, threatened to end
its career in a most undignified fashion. This it very
soon did, as they believed, by resolving itself into a
succession of marshes, to which they gave the name
of the Lachlan Swamps. Being unable to trace the
river any further, Oxley now resolved to abandon
the enterprise and return home by a different route.
He made up his mind, accordingly, to make for the
southern coast, which he hoped to strike about Cape
Northumberland, and thence reach Sydney by sea.
In this direction the course was steered till the 4th
of July, when further progress became extremely
difficult, from the sterility of the country and almost
interminable forests of mallee, which Oxley, in a play
of the imagination, named the Euryalean scrub.
At last it became apparent to all that they would
have to return to the Lachlan, through the want of
water, if for no other cause, and this was now
done. The retrograde movement was singularly
unfortunate. Had they proceeded only twenty miles
further the Murrumbidgee would have been discovered,
with its never-failing volume of water.
But, in their ignorance, it was otherwise determined,
and a laurel lost to the wreath of this distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 40]</a></span>
explorer. Nineteen weary days were consumed on
this return journey, at the end of which the Lachlan
was reached, a long distance below the swamps from
which it had emerged, and was flowing in a strong
current confined within high banks. Waterfowl were
again seen and caught in abundance. Fish also
were plentiful, some of them&mdash;the "Murray cod"&mdash;weighing
sixty or seventy pounds. This good
fortune induced the explorers to continue their
journey down the river, in the hope of reaching
some satisfactory result. This expectation was not
realized. They were again landed among swamps
and marshes, which were now regarded for certain
as the termination of the Lachlan, and the exploration
was conducted no further in this direction. Here, for
the second time, Oxley narrowly missed discovering
the Murrumbidgee, from which he was distant not
more than two days' journey. The Lachlan had now
been followed for about 500 miles from the place
where the expedition had started, and it was resolved
to proceed no further. A return was now made to
Bathurst in an oblique direction, with the intention
of striking the Macquarie at a point considerably
below the place where it had first been seen by
Evans. Some important discoveries were made
during this cross-country cut. The Elizabeth River,
Bell's River, and the Rivulet were met with and
named. Most important of all was the discovery
of Wellington Valley, an extensive tract of the finest
country, well suited to all the purposes of civilized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 41]</a></span>
man, and diversified with scenery of great beauty.
After travelling 150 miles from the lower swamps of
the Lachlan the Macquarie was struck about 50 miles
below the place where it had been seen by Evans. It
was a river of good promise, and Oxley was strongly
inclined to follow it, as he had done the Lachlan,
but the slender remnant of provisions forbade the
attempt. The expedition, therefore, made for
Bathurst, which was reached on the 29th of August,
after an absence of nineteen weeks. The distance
travelled from start to finish amounted to 1,200
miles.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Undeterred by the difficulties incurred on the
Lachlan, Oxley, during the following year (1818),
engaged in a similar expedition for the exploration of
the lower course of the Macquarie. Tracing the
unknown stream to the westward, he found himself
led out of the region of hills into a country presenting
a dead and monotonous level. Here the river began
to lose its well-defined course and to spread its waters
over the dreary expanse. With great difficulty, he
succeeded in distinguishing the river from the lake
for a short distance onward, after which further effort
in a wide waste of water was to no purpose. Now, at
last, he lost sight of land and trees altogether, though
again able to discern the current of the Macquarie in
a stream three feet deep winding in and out among
thickets of reeds, which here grew to a gigantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 42]</a></span>
height. Oxley conjectured he had now reached the
commencement of an inland sea&mdash;a phantom which
long played fast and loose with those who loved to
speculate on the mysterious regions of Central
Australia. In this pet fancy the explorer, like many
other theorists, was quite mistaken, for this delusive
expanse of water was not even the termination of the
Macquarie River. Ten years later Captain Sturt
succeeded in tracing it for 66 miles further, and found
it ending its dubious career in the River Darling.</p>

<p>Two courses were now open to the expedition&mdash;either
to return home disappointed, or strike out in a
new direction and make fresh discoveries. The latter
alternative was adopted. During an earlier part of
the journey their attention had been drawn to a lofty
range of dark mountains lying athwart the northern
horizon. The march was now towards this prominent
landmark of the unknown domain of nature. Before
it was reached, and after the expedition had been out
for about two months, progress was arrested by the
discovery of a river running in high flood. This was
named the Castlereagh, and a safe passage was
obtained after a short delay. There remained a weary
journey to the range which had so long loomed in the
distance, and was reached after much difficulty, owing
to the boggy character of the ground. One of the principal
elevations was ascended, from which a magnificent
prospect was obtained, and the height ascertained to
be about 3,000 feet. Oxley gave to this chain the
name of the Arbuthnot Range, but it is still most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 43]</a></span>
generally known as the Warrambungle Mountains.
The course of the expedition was now directed
toward the east, in the hope of ultimately reaching
the coast somewhere northward of Sydney. This
purpose was rewarded by the discovery of the Liverpool
Plains, the most valuable find that had hitherto fallen
to the lot of any explorer. This is a splendid
area of first-class land, consisting of level country
embracing about 17,000 square miles, supposed to
have formed in past ages the bed of a small inland
sea. The next discovery was the Namoi River, called
after Sir Robert Peel by Oxley, but it is still best
known under the native designation. After traversing
the Liverpool Plains the expedition entered upon the
very dissimilar New England country, and experienced
fatiguing travel in mountain ranges, which was
rewarded by the discovery of another river, named the
Apsley. One of the loftiest peaks in this region was
ascended by Oxley, and found to be about 6,000 feet
in height. From the crown of this mountain giant he
was gratified with a glimpse of the Pacific Ocean, and
very fittingly gave to his position the name of Mount
Seaview. Shortly after the descent from this monarch
of the mountains another important river was met
with. Oxley called it the Hastings, in memory of the
notorious Governor-General of India, and here, for
once, the name has stuck. This river was now
followed to the sea and the entrance named Port
Macquarie, hitherto unknown to Europeans. The
exploring party, having now done their work so well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 44]</a></span>
resolved to make for home by travelling along the
coast. Difficulties undreamt of were encountered in
the indentation of the shore and the estuaries of the
rivers, one of which, the Manning, was now first
discovered. These obstacles might well have proved
insuperable but for their good luck in meeting with a
boat, probably the relic of a wreck, which was
stranded and half-buried in the sand. The welcome
treasure was carried on their shoulders for 90 miles,
and put to use in crossing estuaries as they came in
the way. With this unexpected help in time of need
the party were enabled to reach Port Stephens. This
harbour had been discovered by Surveyor Grimes
and was now well known. Thence conveyance was
obtained by sea to Newcastle, where the toil-worn
adventurers found themselves once more within the
pale of civilization.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>HUME AND HOVELL'S EXPEDITION FROM LAKE GEORGE
TO PORT PHILLIP.</h3>


<p>Sir Thomas Brisbane succeeded to the Government of
New South Wales on the 1st of December, 1821. The
work of exploration, which had received such extraordinary
impulse under Macquarie, was taken up
with corresponding zeal by the new Governor. The
southern limit of discovery at this period stood somewhere
about Lake George; and public attention was
largely directed to the unknown country lying beyond
this outpost. The passion for exploration in this
quarter had been discouraged, but not suppressed, by
a rash and unwarranted statement made by Oxley
in the journal he had given to the world. "We had
demonstrated beyond a doubt," said he, "that no river
could fall into the sea between Cape Otway and
Spencer's Gulf&mdash;at least, none deriving its waters from
the eastern coast&mdash;and that the country south of the
parallel of 34 deg., and west of the meridian 147 deg.
30 min. was uninhabitable and useless for all the purposes
of civilized man." This singularly unfortunate
assertion should have been affirmative instead of
negative, for the principal rivers of the continent
enter the sea within the limits here specified, and
some of the largest tracts of good land in Australia
are enclosed by these lines of longitude and latitude.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Governor Brisbane, fortunately, was not convinced by
this so-called demonstration, and felt disposed to have
the question practically tested. With this object in
view, he proposed to the late Alexander Berry, himself
no mean explorer, to land a small party of convicts
at Cape Howe or Wilson's Promontory, with
instructions, under promise of reward, to find their
way overland to Lake George as they best could, and
ultimately to Sydney. Mr. Berry cordially fell in
with the proposal, and recommended as leader of the
party a young man who had already made his mark
as a bushman. The latter, however, demurred to the
plan of the expedition, wishing it to start from Lake
George and work its way overland to Western Port,
in Bass' Strait. This suggestion was adopted without
scruple or delay, and the offer of his services gladly
accepted.</p>

<p>This young man's name was Hamilton Hume. He
was a native of the colony, having been born at Parramatta
in 1797. In those early days educational
facilities were few, and it fell out from this cause that
Hume owed all the learning he possessed to the
instructions of his kind mother. In after life he was
more indebted to his instincts than to his education.
A bushman, like a poet, is born, not made; and Hume,
before leaving his 'teens, proved that genius for
exploration was part of his nature. In company with
his brother, and when but fifteen years of age, he
discovered the district of Berrima, and shortly after
completely explored that part of the country. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 47]</a></span>
1817 he passed the southern boundary of the known
territory, and, in conjunction with Surveyor Meehan,
made the discovery of Lake Bathurst and the Goulburn
Plains. Again, in the year 1821, he proceeded
further out, along with several mates, and came upon
the Yass Plains. All these discoveries, however valuable
for stockholders, may be regarded as but tentative
essays in the work of exploration in comparison with
what was to follow; yet they must have been highly
advantageous in qualifying Hume for the arduous
expedition on which his fame must chiefly rest.</p>

<p>While the necessary preparations for this undertaking
were afoot, Mr. Berry intimated to the
Governor that another person was desirous of being
associated with Hume in the position of leader. This
was Captain Hovell, of Minto, a retired shipmaster.
Having been a professional navigator, he was presumed
to be able to reckon longitude and latitude, an
accomplishment which the defectively-educated Hume,
with all his bushmanship, did not possess. The two
men being thus furnished with complementary qualifications,
their association in the conduct of the
expedition was counted as a certain advantage. This
was surely a reasonable expectation; but the event
proved that a greater mistake could not have been
made. The two leaders, like jealous rivals, quarrelled
from the start, kept wrangling throughout the
expedition, and, after it was over, maintained a bitter
feud, till death put an end to their animosity. The
principal share in this work, and credit for the results,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 48]</a></span>
have been claimed by both, and it is not easy to satisfy
oneself as to the real merits of the case. All things
considered, the balance of evidence is in favour of
Hume, and he shall have the more prominent place in
the following sketch of the expedition.</p>

<p>However favourable the Government might be to
the progress of discovery, a poor provision was made
for this long and perilous journey. The chief burden
of the equipment fell upon the explorers themselves,
who were ill able to bear the strain. Hume keenly
felt the sacrifice of a favourite iron plough in order to
purchase supplies. One way or other, a tolerable
provision was forthcoming; and then the explorers,
accompanied by six servants, started on the pioneer
journey on the 17th of October, 1824. At the close
of the first day's march they encamped on the bank
of a river near the site of the present town of Yass.
From the 19th to the 22nd the expedition was
detained in its progress by the Murrumbidgee. In
the preceding year this river had been first seen by
Europeans in its upper course in the Monaro country;
but for all that Hume had virtually the merit of being
the discoverer. The Murrumbidgee was found to be
in high flood, and threatened an effectual bar to further
progress. But difficulty aroused this explorer to
Herculean effort. Being supplied with a provision-cart,
Hume took off the wheels, and, with the help of
a tarpaulin, improvised it into a rough-and-ready
punt, which, assisted by one of the men, he dragged
across the swollen river. Another day's march
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 49]</a></span>
brought them to the Narrengullen Meadows, where
the party encamped for two nights. Again proceeding
southward, the Tumut River was discovered, and
crossed without difficulty. Soon after, the expedition
was saluted by a splendid surprise. From the summit
of a ridge, a little before noon on a clear and
beautiful day, the magnificent amphitheatre of the
Australian Alps, robed in snow, burst upon the view,
and was now first seen by civilized men. About this
time, or shortly before, it became evident to Hume that
it would be necessary to direct the line of march more
to the west, in order to avoid the Snowy Mountains.
From this proposal Hovell dissented. Both leaders
continued obstinate, and each persisted in following a
different course with his respective adherents. A
division of property had now become inevitable, and
the principle of partition seems to have been that
primitive one in virtue of which the stronger gets
the larger share. There being only one frying-pan
remaining, each of the stalwart leaders simultaneously
caught hold of this handy domestic article, and the
poor pan went to pieces in the struggle, the result
being such as would have followed the adoption of
Solomon's advice to halve the living child. The
separation of the leaders was not so irremediable as
the division of the frying-pan. Hovell soon discovered
the folly of schism, and, better thoughts prevailing,
returned to re-unite his party with Hume's.</p>

<p>After this incident nothing calling for special mention
occurred till the 16th of November, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 50]</a></span>
signalled by the discovery of the principal river of
Australia. Here was an agreeable surprise, coming as
it did in defiance of the prediction of Oxley, who
was reckoned the highest authority of the period.
Hume called this river after his father; but, forgetful
of this fact, Captain Sturt, having hit it in its lower
course, gave it the name of the Murray, by which it
is now known through its whole length. The party
who thus found themselves brought to a stand-still
naturally looked upon the crossing of so large a river
as a formidable undertaking, and some even insisted
on regarding it as the limit of the expedition&mdash;perhaps
homesickness also was beginning to prevail over
their ardour for exploration. Hume was inflexible, as
usual, threatening to throw one of the remonstrants
into the river if he would not cross over of his own
free will. The menace was effectual, and the heroic
leader had the satisfaction of seeing the whole of the
expedition on the other side of the Murray, having
escaped without a hitch or accident. Soon after, a
tributary, the Mitta Mitta, was reached, and crossed
by means of a float constructed of wattles, and
covered with a tarpaulin. Turning its course more
to the westward, the expedition continued to advance
towards the attainment of its object. Passing near
the site of the present Beechworth, the Ovens and
Goulburn Rivers were crossed without serious difficulty.
In fact, the whole journey up to this point
had been remarkably uneventful for an Australian
tour of exploration. But for the leaders' quarrels and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 51]</a></span>
separations it might have sunk into a rather tame
and monotonous affair. Now at length, however,
a Titanic obstacle had to be encountered. Mount
Disappointment (of which Mount Macedon is a continuation)
stretched across the track, as if to defy
further progress. For a while they nobly persevered
in hewing their way through the dense, tangled, and
apparently interminable brushwood, being animated
by the assurance of Hume that the opposing barrier
could be nothing else than the Dividing Range, which
betokened the near termination of their labours.
Unfortunately the life and soul of the expedition,
now more than ever indispensable to its success, here
met with a disabling accident from a stake. The way
through the scrub had to be abandoned, and a more
circuitous route followed. The most serious difficulty
on the march was a boggy creek in the locality where
the town of Kilmore now stands. Here again an
attempt was made to throw up the undertaking and
return home. Hume, feeling certain in his own mind
that they could not have much further to go, entered
into a compact with the discontents, engaging to turn
back in the course of two or three days should the
goal of the journey fail to come in view within that
period. On the same day, the 13th December, the
Dividing Range, in this part known as the Big Hill,
was finally crossed, and all difficulties came to an end.
Hume, having proceeded a short way in advance, and
keeping an anxious look-out, observed an opening in
the mountains and a falling of the land toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 52]</a></span>
south. This was a clear token heralding the approach
to the close of their wanderings. Hume, alone as he
was, gave way to an outburst of gladness, and awoke
the echoes of the ranges with his lusty cheers. His
men came speedily round him and shared his joy.
Their fatigues and disappointments were henceforth
things to be remembered, but no longer felt. The
same evening they encamped on the splendid Iramoo
Downs, having the ramparts of the range at their
backs, and in three days more saw the long-desired
billows of the ocean rolling at their feet. Having
reached the close of the journey, they formed the
last encampment within twelve miles of the present
town of Geelong, after travelling, since their start
from Lake George, not less than 670 miles.</p>

<h3>ALLAN CUNNINGHAM'S EXPLORATIONS.</h3>


<p>Few visitors to the Sydney Botanic Gardens can fail
to notice a memorial obelisk standing on a shady
islet in the lower grounds. This monument, as the
inscription declares, was erected in memory of Allan
Cunningham, an eminent botanist, and for some time
curator of these Gardens. But beyond the scanty
information here given, very little is now generally
known of the life and work of this worthy man.
Restrained by that modesty which is so often a concomitant
of real genius, he shrank from publicity
during his own brief and busy lifetime; and
posterity, ever too forgetful of the obligations of the
past, have allowed his achievements to lapse into
unmerited oblivion. This is flagrant ingratitude
which should be brought to an end by a generous
endeavour to resuscitate a heroic and patriotic
memory.</p>

<p>Allan Cunningham was born at Wimbledon, England,
on the 13th of July, 1791, and was of Scotch extraction
on the father's side. Being designated for the
bar he entered in due time upon the legal profession,
but soon abandoned it as uncongenial to his tastes
and habits. The study of botany proved an irresistible
fascination to young Allan, who soon became a
proficient in this science. Having been introduced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Sir Joseph Banks, he obtained, through his influence,
an appointment as King's Botanist for Australia, with
the view of furnishing the Royal Gardens at Kew
with a collection of new plants from the southern
hemisphere. He sailed, accordingly, for his destination;
and, after spending a short time in Brazil,
landed in New South Wales, probably in December,
1816. As noticed in a preceding chapter he was
associated with Oxley in his expeditions to the
Lachlan and Macquarie rivers, and it was during
these wanderings that the young botanist conceived
a passion for exploration which did not leave him
till the day of his death. This tour being ended,
Cunningham returned to Parramatta, where he fixed
his home, so far as he had one, during his life in
Australia.</p>

<p>In the close of 1817, the <i>Mermaid</i>, under the command
of Captain, afterwards Admiral, King, was
preparing to leave Port Jackson on a voyage of discovery
on the western coast of Australia. Cunningham,
to his intense satisfaction, received a letter from
Sir Joseph Banks, directing him to join this expedition,
in the interest of botanical science. Sailing
through Bass' Strait the <i>Mermaid</i> came to anchor in
King George's Sound and other harbours, which
proved to be well suited for the botanist's purpose,
and yielded 300 species of new plants. With this
spoil he came home fully satisfied. His next essay in
this field was an excursion to Illawarra, which was
always a favourite district with him. But this ramble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was only an interlude. In 1819 he again joined
Captain King in an expedition to the Macquarie
Harbour, on the western coast of Van Diemen's Land
(Tasmania), where also he collected many valuable
specimens for the Kew Gardens. Soon after he was
again associated with the same navigator on another
voyage to the north-western coast. Still two more
expeditions to the same coast were undertaken and
successfully carried out within the next two years.
The results in every case were highly successful, and
the boundaries of science gained further extension
from these enterprises.</p>

<p>Having spent four years on these voyages with
King, Cunningham became inoculated with the spirit
of adventure, and thirsted for an exploit on his own
account. The feat he proposed to himself was to open a
practical route from Bathurst to the Liverpool Plains.
This splendid district, as already narrated, had been
discovered by Oxley three years previously; but he
had entered it from the western side&mdash;so to speak, by
the back door&mdash;on his journey from the marshes of
the Macquarie. The discovery had, consequently,
been useless, and the Liverpool Plains were as yet
known only by name. Sir Thomas Brisbane, the
Governor of the day, entered heartily into Cunningham's
scheme, having clearly understood the importance
of the object in view. Orders for an equipment
were issued to the full extent of the explorer's requirements.
All things being ready by the 31st of March,
1823, the party, consisting of the leader, with five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 56]</a></span>
men, and five pack-horses, carrying provisions for ten
weeks, left Parramatta for Bathurst, which was
reached on the 5th of April, and then the northward
journey commenced. After many weary stages, during
which the patience of the men and the strength of the
horses were severely tried, they reached the Warrambungle
Mountains, which form the southern boundary
of the Liverpool Plains; but the difficulty in finding
a passage through this barrier appeared to be
insuperable. The first fortnight was spent to no
purpose in attempting to discover an opening on the
south-eastern side. Almost in despair, the party retraced
their steps and fell back on a former encampment
on the Goulburn River, the principal tributary
of the Hunter. Provisions were now getting short,
and the allowance had to be reduced; but, in spite
of all these dispiriting circumstances, Cunningham
still resolved to prosecute his enterprise by making
another struggle to find an entrance from a different
point. Turning now to the north-west, and searching
along the front of the range, he succeeded at last, on
the 5th of June, in discovering a gap which afforded a
good passage into the Liverpool Plains. To this
entrance he gave the name of Pandora's Pass, believing
it would become the chief if not the only means of
communication between the settlers at Bathurst and
the Hunter River and the occupants of the plains.
The following memorandum was buried in a valley
immediately below the pass:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After a very laborious and harassing journey from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Bathurst, a party, consisting of five persons, under
the direction of Allan Cunningham, H.M. Botanist
(making the sixth individual), having failed of finding
a route to the Liverpool Plains, whilst tracing the
south base of the barrier mountains (before us, north),
so far as 50 miles to the eastward of this spot, at
length, upon prosecuting their research under this
great mountain belt, north by west from this tree, to
the very extensive levels connected with the above-mentioned
plains, of which the southernmost of the
chain is distant about 11 or 12 miles N.N.W. from
this valley, and to which a line of trees has been
carefully marked, thus opening an unlimited, unbounded,
and seemingly well-watered country N.N.W.
to call forth the exertions of the industrious agriculturist
and grazier, for whose benefit the present labours
of the party have been extended.... Buried
for the information of the first farmers who may
venture to advance so far to the northward as this
vale; of whom it is requested that this document may
not be destroyed, but carried to the settlement at
Bathurst, after opening the bottle."</p>

<p>This memorandum was found a few years ago, and
the explorer's directions carried out. The object of
the expedition being now accomplished, the party
returned on the homeward track, and Allan Cunningham
reached Parramatta on the 21st of July, 1823.</p>

<p>In the next important enterprise he is found
associated with Oxley, exploring the country around
Moreton Bay. They surveyed the Brisbane River,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 58]</a></span>
pushing up the stream as far as was practicable in
their boat. It turned out to have but a short course,
and they were disappointed in their expectation of
being carried for some distance into the interior. Yet
this labour had the negative value of satisfying the
public that the Brisbane was not one of the great
rivers of Australia. The King's Botanist again found
rich spoil for the Royal Gardens at Kew.</p>

<p>During the winter months of 1825, being again
bent on travel, Cunningham started for a northern
tour. Leaving Parramatta, he crossed the Hawkesbury
and proceeded towards Wollombi, one of the
tributaries of the Hunter River. Still pushing ahead
he reached Mount Danger, then Pandora's Pass, and
entered upon the Liverpool Plains. These he now
found to be a region of swamps and marshes as the
consequence of a rainy season. Having crossed this
district as best he could, the ardent traveller pressed
on through Camden Valley and reached Dunlop's
Head, at no great distance from the River Darling,
which, with a little presentiment, he might soon have
discovered and anticipated Captain Sturt. But as
the country was now beginning to dip perceptibly,
being in many places covered with water, which had
accumulated during recent wet weather, he deemed
prudence the better part of valour, and abandoned a
hopeless enterprise. He was again in his own home
by the 17th of June, having travelled in all about
700 miles.</p>

<p>After a short season of rest, during which New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Zealand was visited, this untiring scientist returned
to the colony and offered himself for further exploration
with renewed zest and zeal. The time was
opportune, for the Governor had been anxiously
looking about for a suitable leader to conduct an
expedition to the distant north. Cunningham's offer
was therefore eagerly accepted, and ample provision
made for his requirements. All things being ready,
the start was made on the 30th of April, 1827, with
six picked men and eleven heavily-laden horsemen.
The route skirted the western flank of the Liverpool
Plains, and by the 11th of May the party entered
upon ground hitherto untrodden by civilized man.
A fine valley now opened to view, and was named the
Stoddart, in remembrance of an old friend of the
explorer's. The Namoi River was next forded, and by
the 25th the hilly country on the west had sunk into the
plain. The scene that now lay before them will be
best described in the words of the leader of the
expedition. "A level open interior of vast expanse,
bounded on the north and north-west by a distant
horizon, broke suddenly on our view. At north-west,
more particularly, it was evident to all of us that the
country had a decided dip, and in that bearing the
line of sight extended over a great extent of densely
wooded or brushed land, the monotonous aspect of
which was here and there relieved by a brown patch
of plain; of these some were so remote as to appear
a mere speck on the <i>ocean</i> of land before us, on
which the eye sought anxiously for a rising smoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 60]</a></span>
as indicative of the presence of the wandering
aborigines, but in vain; for, excepting in the immediate
neighbourhood of a river of the larger magnitude,
these vast solitudes may be fairly said to be
almost entirely without inhabitants. We had now
all the high grounds on our right, or to the east of
us, and before us, to the north, a level wooded country."
These plains which ran out towards the western
interior, having turned out to be drier than was
expected, the line of route was now directed more to
the north and north-west, with the result of discovering
and crossing the Dumaresq River, within a few
days. The course next lay for some time through a
poor and inhospitable country in which the jaded
horses fared badly enough. By the 5th of June, this
sterile belt was left behind, and now the eyes of the
patient explorers rested on one of the finest regions
they had ever beheld. For many a league north, east,
and west the field of vision was filled with a panorama
of boundless plains, rolling downs, and azure
mountain ranges. This magnificent territory, rivalling
a principality in size, was clad with luxuriant vegetation
and generally well watered. The name Darling
Downs was subsequently bestowed on this fine country
in honour of Governor Darling, and it now forms one
of the most valued possessions in the colony of
Queensland. The average elevation of this table-land
Cunningham found to be about 1,800 feet above sea-level.
Had this worthy man performed no other
public service during his lifetime, the discovery of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the Darling Downs would have given him a strong
claim on the gratitude of posterity.</p>

<p>Having now sufficiently realized the aim of the
northern expedition, Allan Cunningham ceased to
push farther in that direction, and made eastward
for the coast. Here also was made an important
discovery on a smaller scale in the unexpected appearance
of a fertile valley, with a river of greater size
than a mountain stream. To both the valley and the
river he gave the name of Logan, in compliment to
the commander of the penal settlement at Brisbane.
The expedition tarried for some time in this lovely
vale, where both men and beasts of burden enjoyed
much-needed repose. Cunningham himself, who
scarcely understood what rest meant, botanized as
usual, and examined the physical configuration of the
country. On a fine morning he scaled one of the
impending peaks, from the summit of which he
obtained a comprehensive view of the situation and
its surroundings. To the south-east, at the distance
of 60 or 70 miles, the towering cone of Mount
Warning, the sailor's beacon, rose in impressive
grandeur; while towards the north-east the environs
of Moreton Bay were plainly visible. This latter
revelation made it obvious that the proper route to
the Darling Downs would be from Moreton Bay, by
the Brisbane River, and through the Main Range.
Hence it became a matter of the first importance to
find a passage through the mountains, if within the
bounds of possibility. An effort was accordingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 62]</a></span>
made, and an opening, as he believed, discovered, but
its complete verification had to be deferred till
another opportunity. The homeward journey was
resumed on the 16th of June. On the 30th, the
Dumaresq River was crossed 50 miles above the outward
bound track of the expedition. In ten days
more a large river was reached, and is now well-known
under the native name Gwydir. They next
came upon a wooded tract, reached by a descent of
1,200 feet, a sore task for the weary horses. On the
19th the party were again on the Liverpool Plains,
and a few days' more travelling brought them to their
welcome homes. They had journeyed over 800 miles,
and been absent thirteen weeks. One noteworthy
incident connected with the tour was the paucity of
native inhabitants met with in any of the districts.
Only five times, from first to last, had the black-fellows
put in an appearance, and even then the
explorers had seen nothing but the colour of their
skin.</p>

<p>Cunningham's health now began to give way, and
he longed to return to old England, to end his days
in the land of his birth; but, before doing so, he
planned and executed another exploring excursion to
Moreton Bay. His principal object was to obtain
certain evidence of the existence and practicability of
the pass, which he believed to have been already
discovered. After much rough work he had the
good fortune to set this question at rest and point out
a passage into the Darling Downs, as he had formerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 63]</a></span>
done into the Liverpool Plains. This pass still retains
the name of Cunningham's Gap. The following
succinct but sufficient notice is found in the explorer's
own notes:&mdash;"This pass, or door of entrance from the
sea-coast to a beautiful pastoral country of undefined
extent, seen from this point, was this day (25th August,
1828) visited by Allan Cunningham and a convict
servant, and the practicability of a high road being
constructed through it at some future day was most
fully ascertained. The pass is in latitude 23¬∞ 3' S.,
and longitude 152¬∞ 26' E., and distant 54 statute
miles from Brisbane Town." Four years later he was
able to carry out his purpose of returning to England;
but his heart was in Australia all the while, and he
became impatient to get back to its sunny skies and
balmy air. On being offered the situation of Colonial
Botanist he accepted the appointment, and returned
to the land of so many of his labours; but his new
office was not what he expected. Besides keeping the
Botanic Gardens, which would, alone, have been a
most congenial occupation, he was required to act as
landscape gardener for the upper classes and take
charge of one hundred convicts, forty of whom
were lodged in the barracks within the Gardens, and
for whose good behaviour the curator was alone
responsible. In addition to all this drudgery he was
compelled to grow vegetables for the Government
officials. Such servitude was breaking his heart, and
it can surprise no one to find him throwing up the
appointment in disgust. This undignified treatment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of a man of shining merits is tartly alluded to in the
<i>Sydney Mail</i> of the 29th January, 1838:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Botanical, alias the Kitchen Garden.</span>&mdash;We
have had frequently to call the attention of the
colonists to the fact that a kitchen garden, under the
pretence of a botanic garden, is supported in Sydney
at an expense of from ¬£800 to ¬£1,000 a year. We
scarcely ever walk through this garden without
seeing some servant with a basket, carrying off
vegetables or fruit for Mrs. This or Mrs. That, the
wife of some official. Can't these people go to market
and purchase their supplies as independent persons
do, instead of poaching on what is really public
property. Seriously we do say that such an impudent
job should be done away with. It is, in fact, so bare-faced
that Mr. Cunningham would no longer consent
to remain a mere cultivator of official turnips and
cabbages, and accordingly he has resigned the management
of the Botanic Garden in disgust."</p>

<p>This valuable life was now fast hastening to its
close. Twenty-five years of incessant labour, often
performed under the most trying circumstances, broke
down a constitution never particularly robust, and
feeling this to be the case, Allan Cunningham retired
from public view into his own hired house&mdash;but only
to die. At the early age of 48 years, perceiving the
hand of death to be upon him, he calmly resigned
himself to the will of his Maker, and died as becomes
a Christian. He expired on the 27th of June, 1839.
Admiral King, who had stood his firm friend during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the quarter of a century of Cunningham's active life,
refers to his own bereavement in these touching
words:&mdash;"Alas, poor Allan! He was a rare specimen,
quite a genus of himself; an enthusiast in Australian
geography; devoted to his own science, botany; a
warm friend, and an honest man; and, to crown all,
when the time came, he resigned himself into the
arms of his Saviour without a murmur."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN STURT'S THREE EXPEDITIONS.</h3>


<p>The next hero that steps to the front is Charles Sturt,
captain of the 39th regiment, which was stationed at
Sydney in the early days of our history. He stands,
beyond all question, in the first rank of Australian
explorers. His single compeer, Sir Thomas Mitchell,
was more fortunate in discovery, but it may be doubted
whether he excelled Captain Sturt in real capability
for this work. The future historian will probably
decide the rival claims by bracketing the two names
as holding a joint first in Australian exploration.
Naturally brave, resolute, and patient in labour, Sturt
was, moreover, a man of varied culture and extensive
scientific acquirements. As an officer in the army he
had been accustomed to command, and at no time did
he experience any difficulty in managing the several
exploring parties under his charge, although they
were mostly drawn from the ordinary convict element
at Port Jackson. This influence over others may have
been due to natural tact even more than to acquired
habit, but in either case it proved a valuable qualification,
and served him in good stead with the native
population as well as with his own men. His heroism
often brought him into situations of extreme peril,
being sometimes environed with savages well armed
and out of all proportion to the number of his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 67]</a></span>
men; but his adroitness never failed to extricate
himself and party from the most imminent danger.
Scarcely any of our explorers opened up so much of
the interior, or so frequently came into contact with
savage tribes, and yet his humane disposition preserved
him all through his career from shedding the blood of
a single individual of that unhappy race which others,
with less excuse, have not scrupled to shoot down like
dogs. When stooping under the weight of years,
with a constitution enfeebled by heroic exertions, and
so afflicted with blindness as to be unable to finish
his narrative without the aid of an amanuensis, the
veteran explorer devoutly thanked God that, amid all
his critical encounters and hair-breadth escapes, he
had been saved from the necessity of shedding a drop
of blood from the veins of the Australian aborigines.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>As early as the year 1818 the Macquarie River had
been explored as far as practicable by John Oxley,
the Surveyor-General. This indefatigable traveller
had traced its course into the far interior till it
seemed lost and appeared to terminate in a series of
swamps, overgrown with dense reeds. All his efforts
to proceed further westward proved unavailing, and
he turned aside to other work, being under the
impression that he had seen all that was visible of the
Macquarie. Like some others of his time, Oxley had
taken up with the idea of a mediterranean sea which
was supposed to cover the interior of Australia; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 68]</a></span>
such being his opinion, it was natural to fancy he had
reached its margin in those swamps of seemingly
indefinite extent into which the Macquarie poured its
flood. During the next ten years Cunningham had
pushed as far north as the Darling Downs, while
Hume and Hovell had been equally successful in
forcing their way south to Port Phillip; but out west
no progress was made beyond the goal of Oxley's
explorations. But ignorance of the interior hung like
a cloud over the settlement, a vague feeling of mystery
kept curiosity awake, and a general desire began to
be expressed for fresh explorations in that direction.
The times, too, which in other respects happened to be
signally disastrous, appeared to be just as favourable
for such an enterprise. A drought of several years'
standing was then devastating the colony; but this
misfortune, which brought ruin to the doors of so
many settlers, seemed, strangely enough, to be a strong
recommendation to start an exploring expedition. It
had been Oxley's misfortune to examine the country
during an exceptionally wet season, and it was
conjectured that floods had laid under water the low-lying
country on the further reaches of the Macquarie,
and thus interposed a temporary obstruction to the
westward advance of exploration. But now, after a
drought of long standing, it was hoped that the
swamps, if not dried up, would at least be so much
reduced as to render the much-desired object more
likely to be accomplished.</p>

<p>Governor Darling, accordingly, determined on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 69]</a></span>
sending out another expedition. In the all-important
question of a leader, he was singularly fortunate in
selecting Captain Sturt. The latter took as his
associates Mr. Hamilton Hume, who had already
gained his own laurels in exploration, Staff-Surgeon
M'Leod, two soldiers, and eight convicts. The instructions
received from headquarters were, generally, to
follow up the discoveries of Oxley, to endeavour to
ascertain the "fate" of the Macquarie, and to put
forth the utmost effort to penetrate westward to the
furthest possible limit.</p>

<p>All the material requisites for the expedition were
forwarded to Wellington Valley, which at that time
was the outpost of civilization toward the west, and
Sturt was instructed to form his dep√¥t at Mount
Harris, which had been Oxley's most advanced
encampment ten years earlier. All preparations being
made, the party left Sydney on the 10th of September,
1828, under the command of Captain Sturt, who
only a week previously had followed the remains of
Oxley to the grave. After a few days of uneventful
travelling through the settled territory, Wellington
Valley was reached, and, by the 10th of December,
the explorers were encamped at Mount Harris, the
<i>ne plus ultra</i> of their predecessors, and near the supposed
termination of the Macquarie River. Although
ten years had passed away, traces of the old camp
were easily found. From the summit of the mountain
a good prospect towards the interior was obtained, and
a tolerably favourable impression left on the minds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Sturt and Hume. The marshes were seen to be dried
up in some places altogether, and in others very much
contracted, and, as the bed of the river continued to
be well defined, there did not appear to be much
difficulty in pushing the limit of discovery considerably
beyond the line at which it had stood for ten
years past.</p>

<p>Following the course of the Macquarie for some
miles westward, it was found to enter a swamp of
considerable size. As the sluggish current was the
only clue to lead them through this ambiguous tract of
land and water, it was deemed indispensable to keep
to the channel at all hazards as it meandered through
the marshes. For this purpose Sturt here turned
to account a good-sized boat which had, with a wise
foresight, been provided among the travelling
requisites. But their progress by water proved to be
less expeditious than it had been on the land, for the
channel wriggled like a snake, and the navigation was
provokingly hindered by snags. Gradually the course
of the river became better defined, but only to lose
itself again in a labyrinth of creeks and marshes.
Puzzled and bewildered, with no hope of further
progress in the boat, Sturt and Hume resolved to
make separate excursions to the right and left, each
taking his own complement of followers. Many
hardships had to be endured from heat and drought,
while the results were not very considerable. Sturt
rode over 200 miles of desert country and was much
fatigued. The principal discoveries made about this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 71]</a></span>
time were Oxley's Table-land and New Year's Creek,
mistaken by the explorers for a branch of the
Macquarie, but which was in reality the Bogan River.
Eventually both sections of the expedition reunited
and bravely struck out for the interior, giving
defiance to thirst and fatigue, and devoutly wishing
for something to turn up. They had not far to go
till this desire was realized. At a moment when they
were not thinking of it, the foremost of the party
found their progress stopped on the bank of one of
the principal rivers in Australia. Its ample channel
extended to seventy or eighty yards in breadth, and
its bosom was covered with wild fowl of every wing.
Almost perishing with thirst, both man and beast
rushed down the shelving bank, and in a moment
were gulping down the water of the welcome stream.
Never did travellers meet with so "bitter" a disappointment.
"I shall never forget," says Sturt, "the
cry of amazement or the look of terror with which
they cried out to inform me that the river was so salt
as to be unfit to drink." The cup of relief was
dashed from their lips, and they were left to the most
gloomy reflections on the future supply of this
element. They conjectured, not unnaturally, that
this saline quality must be derived from near contact
with the sea, and anxiously watched for the slightest
indications of a rising or a falling tide, but to no
purpose. The cause was afterwards traced to briny
springs in the river's banks, which must have been a
temporary occurrence, for the same inconvenience is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 72]</a></span>
not met with now. The discovery in all other
respects was clearly perceived to be of the utmost
value, and went far to annihilate the pet theory of an
inland sea, which thus kept receding further and
further from human ken. It was already evident that
this noble river must play a principal part in the
drainage of the western slope of the mountain ranges,
and we now know that it forms the backbone of
the river system of eastern Australia and the highway
of intercolonial commerce. Sturt, therefore, paid
Governor Darling no mean compliment in associating
his name with this grand discovery and calling it the
Darling River.</p>

<p>The expedition now followed the lead of the River
Darling for about sixty-six miles. As the country
continued to be inhospitable, the blacks troublesome,
and the supply of water precarious, it was resolved to
proceed no further in that direction. A return was
accordingly made to the dep√¥t at Mount Harris, which
was reached partly by way of New Year's Creek, or
the Bogan River, without any serious mishap being
encountered.</p>

<p>Among the secondary instructions given to the
expedition was a direction to push northwards, if
baffled and driven back from the western interior.
They had not failed in that quarter by any means,
but as their work there was finished, and a good supply
of provisions left, it was thought advisable to attempt
a journey to the Castlereagh, which was simply
known to exist. In this effort they were again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 73]</a></span>
successful. Having travelled by way of Morriset's
Ponds, a sufficient supply of water was obtained to
help them on to the Castlereagh, where, of course, it
was expected to be abundant, seeing that Oxley had
been able to cross it after some delay and with much
difficulty. But this anticipation was doomed to disappointment.
The bed of the river was found to be
as dry as dust. The explorers, after a long search,
hit upon only one small pool in the sand which yielded
but a temporary supply. The Castlereagh was now
traced towards its supposed junction with the Darling
for the distance of 100 miles, 45 of which were
destitute of water. But their perseverance was
rewarded with a second view of the Darling, which
was struck about 90 miles above the point where the
original discovery had been made. The stream here
swarmed with fish, but was still salt and unfit to drink.
Having crossed over to the further side, a dash was
made by a short excursion into the interior, which
proved, like the other side, to be a parched wilderness.
The state of the country as observed throughout this
journey is thus summed up in Sturt's narrative:&mdash;"So
long had the drought continued that the vegetable
kingdom was almost annihilated, and minor vegetation
had almost disappeared. In the creeks weeds had
grown and withered and grown again, and young
saplings were now rising in their beds nourished by
the moisture that still remained; but the largest
forest trees were drooping, and many were dead. The
emus, with outstretched necks, gasping for breath,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 74]</a></span>
searched the channels of the river for water in
vain; and the native dog, so thin that it could hardly
walk, seemed to implore some friendly hand to
despatch it. How the natives subsisted it was difficult
to say, but there was no doubt of the scarcity of food
amongst them." Surely this was no place to loiter in
after the work was fairly accomplished. Contenting
themselves with the substantial discoveries already
made, the explorers resolved to return to the haunts
of civilization. They soon found themselves in the
lovely Wellington Valley, from which the expedition
had been absent four months and a half. After
another journey through the settled districts, each of
the weary wanderers reached his home, no one having
sustained any injury to life or limb during this long
and hazardous enterprise.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Captain Sturt enjoyed but a very limited repose
after the fatigues of the Macquarie expedition. He
had returned to Sydney about the beginning of May,
1829, and in September of the same year his undying
enthusiasm was once more gratified with instructions
from headquarters to get ready for a full exploration
of the Murrumbidgee. The Macquarie and the
Lachlan, terminating their respective courses in
miserable swamps, or being believed to do so, had
proved delusive guides to the interior of the continent.
But the colonists were resolved to know the heart of
Australia at all hazards. It was still believed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 75]</a></span>
some river must lead thither, all previous disappointments
notwithstanding. The Murrumbidgee alone
remained as an untried experiment, and the little that
was yet known of this river gave hope of a successful
result. It had been first seen by two military officers,
Currie and Ovens, on their discovery of the Monaro
country in 1823, and in the year following it was
crossed with difficulty by Hume and Hovell on their
journey to Port Phillip. Here, at last, was a stream
something like those of other countries, rising in the
Alpine mountain-land, and flowing with a strong and
rapid current in that direction to which the eyes of
explorers were being so anxiously turned. It was
determined, therefore, to equip another expedition,
under the command of Captain Sturt, to explore its
unknown course, for the purpose of ascertaining
whether it emptied itself into an inland sea or
found its way to the southern or to the eastern
coast. The party, under Sturt's leadership, consisted
of Mr. George Macleay, son of the Colonial Treasurer,
Mr. Frazer, botanist, and six others. Among other
requisites a whale-boat was provided, which eventually
proved of the utmost service to the purpose in view.</p>

<p>The expedition left Sydney, in full force and high
spirits, on the 3rd November, 1829. Goulburn Plains
were reached by the 15th, and on the 25th the
Murrumbidgee was struck, not far from Jugiong. The
appearance of the stream was quite up to Sturt's
expectations, but the rugged country on its banks
delayed the passage of the drays, and their progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 76]</a></span>
was not very rapid. In a little time they reached the
junction of the Dumot (Tumut) River, which considerably
increased the volume of the Murrumbidgee,
and this addition was accepted as a good omen. In
their course along the river, sometimes on one side
and sometimes on the other, occasional plains were
traversed, extending from 400 to 700 acres in extent,
and wholly devoid of timber. Lower down the river
one of much larger size was reached, and here the
explorers were not sorry to make a short break in the
journey. The natives called this plain Pondebadgery.
Its size was three and a half by two miles, the soil
being rich and the scenery exquisite. On one side
was the bend of the river, here 80 yards wide, and
abounding in fish, one of which was found to weigh
40 pounds. Hamilton Plains were next discovered,
and named after a favourite staff-surgeon. The
expedition, it was believed, had now come within 25
miles of the most southern point attained by Oxley.
This notable explorer, having reached the swamps of
the Lachlan, and being thus driven to his wits' end,
resolved to strike southward and make for the coast,
but want of water determined him to return to the
Lachlan, after weeks of toilsome travel; whereas, had
he only pushed on another 25 miles, the Murrumbidgee
would have been discovered, and a new era opened in
Australian exploration. Sturt attempted to connect
the surveys of Oxley's expedition with his own, but
was not successful. As travelling continued to be
slow and difficult, it was resolved to launch the boat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and build a skiff to convey the provisions. This was
accordingly done, some of the party being at the same
time sent back to Goulburn with the drays. Seven
days having been consumed in these preparations, the
remainder of the party boldly committed themselves
to the stream. Sturt had a strong presentiment that
the Murrumbidgee would join some other river, and
hoped to find it navigable for his boat during the
remainder of its course. On the following day a serious
mishap occurred. The skiff was sunk by a snag, and
the provisions, after being much damaged, had to be
recovered by diving. The enterprise was a hazardous
one at the best. What with rapids at one time and
snags at another, their lives on several occasions were
in real jeopardy. But the longest lane has its turning,
and this tortuous channel also had an end. On the
seventh day after taking to the boat the bed of the
river became strangely contracted, and the current so
powerful that, in place of rowing, all their strength
was needed to steady the boat, which was borne along
with the swiftness of an arrow, and in another moment
shot forth impetuously into the broad reach of the
finest river in Australia. "It is impossible for me,"
says Sturt, "to describe the effect of so instantaneous
a change of circumstances upon us. The boats were
allowed to drift along at pleasure, and such was the
force with which we had been shot out of the Murrumbidgee
that we were carried nearly to the bank
opposite its embouchure whilst we continued to gaze
in silent astonishment on the capacious channel we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 78]</a></span>
had entered, and when we looked for that by which
we had been led into it we could hardly believe that
the insignificant gap that presented itself to us was
indeed the termination of the beautiful stream whose
course we had thus successfully followed. I can only
compare the relief we experienced to that which the
seaman feels on weathering the rock upon which he
expected that his vessel would have struck, to the
calm which succeeds moments of feverish anxiety,
when the dread of danger is succeeded by the certainty
of escape." This was indeed a noble river. Its width
was 350 feet, its depth not less than 12, and its
current was running at the rate of two and a half
knots an hour. The discoverers believed they had
now obtained ample reward for all their toils and
trials. This was the same river which had been
discovered and crossed by Hume and Hovell where
the town of Albury now stands, but between that
point, where it had been first seen by civilized man,
and the part now visited by Sturt, it had received so
many tributaries as to make it a much larger and, in
a sense, another river. Sturt called it the Murray,
after the Imperial Colonial Secretary, but the original
discoverer had named its upper course the Hume in
memory of his father. For a time these names were
confined to the respective parts of the river; and Dr.
Lang censured Count Strzelecki for departing from
this usage in his published work. General practice
has now deserted the Doctor and followed the Count.</p>

<p>The number and persistent hostility of the aborigines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 79]</a></span>
formed a serious obstacle to the progress of this
expedition. It was computed that no fewer than
4,000 were met with on the Murray. They were a
low type even for Australian savages, and did not
give evidence of a single redeeming quality. Addicted
to every vice, living in the deepest sink of bestiality,
with bodies in many cases rotting with disgusting
diseases, they presented a loathsome spectacle, and
were avoided whenever possible. Even when not
disposed to be openly hostile, their presence at the
camp was a terrible nuisance, and they were generally
persuaded to leave, or hunted away. Sometimes they
would rally their forces, and then prove not only
troublesome but really dangerous. Like all savages
they were adepts in deceit, and could wait their
opportunity when a purpose had to be served. By
dint of numbers and strategy together, they nearly
succeeded on one occasion in annihilating the
expedition. So long as the river maintained its usual
width the boat was tolerably safe in the middle of the
channel, for the spears of the savages were nearly
harmless when they reached the centre of the stream,
but their progress was rapidly approaching a spit which
stretched far into the channel, and this position was
seen to be occupied by blacks numbering more than
fifty to one of Sturt's party. The situation was awfully
critical, and in a few minutes more appeared to be
positively desperate, for the boat grounded in shoal-water,
and the explorers were at the mercy of the
savages. Happily at this juncture some other natives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 80]</a></span>
who had previously been friendly to the white men,
arrived on the scene, and, through a somewhat
barbarous style of intercession, prevailed with their
sable fraternity in the interest of Sturt, and the
murderous attack was immediately abandoned.</p>

<p>Travel through an unknown country is usually a
series of surprises, and it was no ordinary one that
was now in store for the explorers. The spit which
had threatened to be so disastrous proved to be an
embankment silted up by the entrance of another
large river into the Murray. Sturt had already been
looking out for the junction of the Darling, which he
had discovered on the previous expedition; and the
question now to be determined was whether this could
be the embouchure of the same river. He had struck
the Darling at two points only a few months before,
and at both places its water had been found too salt
to drink; here, however, it was quite fresh; but in all
other respects appearances were in favour of this river,
and the Darling Sturt maintained it to be. For years
after his decision was disputed, and even ridiculed by
an authority of no less weight than Sir Thomas
Mitchell. Subsequent exploration finally settled the
question in Sturt's favour. The river was and could
have been no other but the Darling, and thus another
important problem of Australian geography was
satisfactorily solved.</p>

<p>Day after day the boat, with its adventurous crew,
glided down the united stream of the Murray and the
Darling. Sometimes they passed over wide and long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 81]</a></span>
reaches, stretching out for many miles, but occasionally,
too, much difficulty was experienced in clearing the
rapids. For a considerable part of the course the
banks were high and steep, but usually picturesque.
The country, so far as could be judged from a passing
boat, was mostly of the poorest quality, offering
scarcely a patch likely to reward the labour of the
farmer. In one respect Sturt was the most unfortunate
of the explorers. From first to last he hardly
ever had the good luck to hit upon a large tract of
fine country, the Alexandrina district excepted. His
mission seemed to be the discovery of deserts, and of
these he made known more than enough to give
Australia a bad name. Such being Sturt's ill-fortune,
it is not surprising to find him indulging in gloomy
views regarding the great interior; but even in these
forebodings he fell short of Oxley, who was quite a
Cassandra in his way. In the introduction to his
narrative the Captain tries to account for the predominance
of poor land in this outlying region of the
world, and is inclined to attribute it to the want of
decaying vegetable matter, as the trees seldom shed
their leaves, and the little that is supplied from this
or other sources being usually destroyed by bush fires.
But Australia is not the desert land which Sturt
imagined, or even portrayed, as will be seen further on.
Its richest lands were yet locked up, and this same
explorer was unconsciously preparing the key by
which they were to be opened to private enterprise
and the public benefit. Between the entrance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Darling and what is now known as the Great Bend
an important tributary was observed to fall in from
either side. The one from the north Sturt called the
Rufus, in honour of Mr. George Macleay, the second
on the expedition. Probably the reader fails to
perceive the point of the compliment. It lies just
here: Mr. Macleay possessed a splendid head of red
hair, and <i>rufus</i> being the Latin for red, down it
went for the name of the river. The Captain, notwithstanding
his sombre tinge, must have had a quiet vein
of humour in his composition. The other tributary
was called the Lindsay, after a gentleman of that
name who was then Acting-Governor of the colony.
On gaining the lower reaches of the Murray it was
observed to widen rapidly, and at the 35¬∞ 15' of
S. latitude expanded into a magnificent lake 60 miles
long and 50 in width, which was named Alexandrina,
in honour of the young princess, who soon after
became Queen Victoria. When the far end of the lake
had been reached, persistent but unavailing attempts
were made to get the boat to sea. Before leaving
Sydney it had been arranged to send a small vessel to
St. Vincent Gulf to wait for the expedition, that
being the most likely quarter for it to turn up if its
course should be directed towards the southern coast.
The appointed rendezvous was not far off, and the
explorers had every reason to strive to reach it; but
it was to no purpose that they wearied themselves in
the effort. The narrow and tortuous channel which
connected Lake Alexandrina with Encounter Bay was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 83]</a></span>
impracticable even for a boat. It was, therefore,
necessary to return by the way they had come. This
was an awfully serious matter. They had now been
32 days in the boat, during which one-half of the
provisions had been consumed. If the dep√¥t on the
Murrumbidgee was to be reached on the remaining
moiety, it could only be by rowing up the river in
the same period of time they had taken to glide
down the current. This appeared to be scarcely
possible, but all their strength was put forth, and they
displayed such pluck and perseverance as shed
enduring lustre on the heroism of Australian
exploration. "Our journeys," writes Sturt, "were
short, and the head we made against the stream but
trifling. The men had lost the proper and muscular
jerk with which they once made the waters foam and
the oars bend. Their whole bodies swung with an
awkward and laboured motion. Their arms appeared
to be nerveless, and their faces became haggard, their
persons emaciated, their spirits wholly sank&mdash;nature
was so completely overcome that, from mere exhaustion,
they frequently fell asleep during their painful and
almost unceasing exertions. I became captious, and
found fault where there was no occasion, and lost
the equilibrium of my temper in contemplating the
condition of my companions. No murmur, however,
escaped them, nor did any complaint reach me that
was intended to indicate that they had done all they
could do. I frequently heard them in their tent, when
they thought I had dropped asleep, complaining of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 84]</a></span>
severe pains and of great exhaustion. 'I must tell
the Captain to-morrow,' some of them would say,
'that I can pull no more!' To-morrow came, and
they pulled on, as if reluctant to yield to circumstances.
Macnamee at last lost his senses. We first
observed this from his incoherent conversation, but
eventually from his manner. He related the most
extraordinary tales, and fidgetted about eternally in
the boat." In such a plight did they reach the dep√¥t
on the Murrumbidgee. Altogether 88 days were spent
in the boat, and the distance travelled could not have
been less than 4,000 miles. The rest of the journey
was performed by easy stages, the party arriving in
Sydney on the 25th of May, after an absence of
almost seven months.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The discovery of a rich territory on Lake Alexandrina,
was made in 1830, and before another decade
had passed away the settlement of South Australia
was established in this promising region. By a
singular fatality, Sturt, as an explorer, had the
infelicity of stumbling continually upon deserts, or
on tracts only a shade better; but the termination of
the Murray, which he had navigated so courageously,
brought him to the borders of an ample area of the
richest land in Australia. In these circumstances it
was natural for him to evince a special fondness for
the locality which had been the most fortunate, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 85]</a></span>
was also the latest, of his discoveries. The retired
explorer accordingly settled down with his family in
this chosen haunt, with the intention of making his
permanent home in the young colony of South Australia.
He received a civil appointment as Surveyor-General,
which enabled him to live in comparative
quiet and comfort, and he was highly respected for
his great services to Australia in general. After so
many years of retirement, probably no one expected
to hear anything further of Charles Sturt as an
explorer. It could not, therefore, fail to produce a
feeling of surprise when it became known that after
fourteen years' repose he had sought and obtained
from Lord Stanley the necessary requisites for another
expedition into the interior. He had again become
fired with his old ambition, and was now covetous of
the honour of being the first European to plant his foot
on the centre of Australia. All things being in readiness
for this heroic undertaking, Sturt left Adelaide
on the 15th of August, 1844, with a party of fourteen
men, amply provisioned. He chose the route of the
Darling and Murray rivers, which he proposed to follow
till the outskirts of civilization were reached. The
Murray was struck at "Murrundi," the residence at
that time of another noted explorer, Mr. E. J. Eyre, who
had recently accomplished his adventurous journey
round the Great Australian Bight, and the river valley
was thereafter traversed as far as the junction of the
Williorara, a locality better known now under the
name of the Laidley Ponds. This place was becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 86]</a></span>
known to overlanders, and it was hoped it might
prove a suitable site for the first dep√¥t; but this
expectation was hardly justified by personal inspection,
and it became evident that the expedition must
proceed at once into the interior. Sturt accordingly
gathered his party around him, and, having engaged
in appropriate devotional exercises, in which he committed
himself and his men to the watchful care of
Almighty God, launched bravely forth into the perils
of the wilderness. Some distance ahead a mountain
chain was visible, to which the name of Stanley, or
Barrier Range, was afterwards given. The march
was at first directed towards these heights, in the
hope that a river might be discovered on the opposite
fall which would lead into the interior. Here again
expectation was doomed to disappointment, and the
expedition was forced to proceed along the range,
where water alone was to be found. Gradually the
mountains sank into the plains to the northward, and
it was resolved to strike out for the centre from this
point, taking the risk of obtaining a sufficient supply of
water at tolerable intervals. The country traversed in
this direction proved to be cheerless and sterile in the
extreme, and the journey was tedious and trying to a
corresponding degree. Nevertheless, the party pressed
forward, doing their best to deserve success. But it
was to no purpose. The country became still more
inhospitable, and water utterly failed. It was evident
that the object of the expedition could not be reached
by this route, and Sturt, wearied in body and chafed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 87]</a></span>
in spirit, was compelled to retreat to the mountains
on his outward track. This was his first repulse from
the centre of Australia.</p>

<p>A return was made to the dep√¥t, which had fortunately
been established not far from the range, in a
lovely oasis in the desert. No reader of the narrative
of the expedition can soon forget the strange incidents
of this dep√¥t in the Rocky Glen, which unexpectedly
became the prison-house of the whole party for six
months. The supply of water here was good and
abundant, though not inexhaustible; and this advantage
was of supreme importance, as a drought of
unparalleled severity was fast closing in upon the
expedition. Being wearied and worn out by the toilsome
journey to the northward, Sturt resolved to give
his men a brief breathing time in this favoured spot;
and when this temporary repose was ended he found,
to his consternation, that his retreat was cut off, while
it was equally impossible to advance. Here is his
own description of the heat and misery they had to
undergo:&mdash;"The tubes of the thermometer burst, the
bullocks pawed the ground to get a cooler footing, the
men's shoes were scorched as if by fire, their finger
nails were brittle as glass; the lead dropped from the
pencil, the ink dried in the pen, as Sturt wrote up his
daily journal; the drays almost fell to pieces, the
screws loosened in their boxes, the horn handles of the
instruments and their combs split, the wool on the
sheep and their own hair ceased to grow." Many
persistent efforts were made on every side to find a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 88]</a></span>
way of escape; but all to no purpose, for the drought
had closed them in as effectually as a besieging army.
There was no help for it but to make the best of their
misfortune until rain came to the rescue. Fortunately
they had sufficient feed and plenty of water for their
live stock, and for such mercies they were truly
thankful. As the summer advanced it was found
necessary to seek a partial refuge from the scorching
rays of the sun in an underground chamber, which
had been constructed for this purpose. The imprisonment
had, at the same time, a few negative advantages.
For one thing, the completeness of their isolation
formed a sufficient safeguard against the assaults of
the barbarous tribes of the interior; for the same
calamity which prevented the one party from getting
away equally prohibited the other from approaching
this oasis in the desert. During the six months'
detention only one blackfellow had been able to put
in an appearance, and not till reduced to the last
extremity of hunger and thirst. The poor emaciated
creature was prevailed upon to remain for the present;
but, having free access to the explorers' mutton, he
grew tolerably fat in the course of a fortnight, when,
with the usual gratitude of the barbarian, he turned
his back upon his benefactors and took the way that
pleased him best. The accounts of the interior which
Sturt received from this and other aborigines he had
previously encountered were disheartening in the
extreme, and it was impossible to abstain from gloomy
forebodings during this period of enforced incarceration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 89]</a></span>
But whether they were to have any more travelling
or not was becoming more and more a matter of bare
probability. The herbage of the valley had become
reduced to mere dust, and the water had diminished
so ominously as to make it apparent that, unless rain
fell within a month, the party would certainly find
their graves in the Rocky Glen, as one of them had
already done. But the future had better things in
store, and did not longer withhold them. In one of
those sudden changes so characteristic of the Australian
climate the sky assumed its curtain of clouds and
burst in a storm of rain, which deluged the valley.
The roar of the rushing water, Sturt avers, was the
sweetest music that ever fell upon his ear. That
welcome thunderstorm was the key which opened the
door of the prison and gave liberty to the captives.</p>

<p>This happy release was followed by a period of
successful travelling&mdash;not, indeed, void of difficulty,
but yet without much of stirring incident. Another
dep√¥t was formed, which is well known under the
name of the Park. Having enjoyed a short breathing
time here, the expedition again proceeded eastward,
and touched on the northern extremity of Lake
Torrens. A survey of this part having been made, in
accordance with special instructions, they returned
to the Park Dep√¥t, which was reached just twelve
months after Sturt had left Adelaide. As time
was thus rapidly passing away, he now resolved to
put forth all his strength in a bold effort to reach the
summit of his ambition and place his foot on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 90]</a></span>
centre of Australia. Wishing to have as little encumbrance
as possible, he divided his party, and, having
picked three of the best men, started for the goal of
his weary journeys, leaving the remainder in the
dep√¥t. Day after day this forlorn hope toiled on.
Plain succeeded plain over a dreary expanse of
interminable country, redeemed only by a series of
parallel watercourses, which afforded a sufficient supply
of that indispensable element. One important creek
was crossed, but had to be abandoned, as it headed in
a wrong direction. Happily, a sufficient compensation
was found in the discovery of another creek, which
they called the Eyre, after the adventurous explorer;
and this godsend in the wilderness they were able to
follow for a long distance. It was after they were
compelled to leave it that they entered upon the stern
realities of travel in the untrodden interior. The
country now assumed an aspect so sterile and forbidding
as to place it out of comparison with anything
which Sturt, the discoverer of deserts, had previously
witnessed. For a space of 20 miles nothing was
found but a series of sand-ridges succeeding one
another with the monotonous regularity of the waves
of the sea. The fatigue which had to be endured in
crossing this inhospitable tract was indescribable. It
greatly weakened the strength of the party, and it
was only the hope of soon meeting a change of country
which lured them on. Nor was this expectation
doomed to disappointment, for a change they met
with at a moment's notice. All of a sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the jaded explorers found a stony desert springing
up beneath their feet and stretching away as
far as the eye could reach, while it included within
its ghastly embrace more than half the horizon. The
suddenness of the appearance of this spectre of
desolation struck them mute with surprise and horror.
One of Sturt's attendants was the first to break the
silence, which he did by raising his hands and
exclaiming&mdash;"Good heavens! did ever man see such
country?" Probably he never did. It is worse even
than the African Sahara. It is beyond the power of
words to describe it as it stands in its lone and
dread reality. Sturt's Stony Desert is one unbroken
expanse of desolation, a wilderness of red ferruginous
sandstone, undergoing perpetual disintegration, constituting
a natural ruin on a gigantic scale, without a
single redeeming feature. Barrenness has marked
this region for her own, and will ever hold it as a
special possession. No life can subsist within its
borders; the foot of the savage is not upon its wastes,
and the whole region is still and silent as the grave.
Such is the dark picture as drawn by the explorer
himself. Happily a better acquaintance has led to
a more favourable opinion; though the land of
spinifex, it produces other vegetation of nutritive and
even fattening properties. The Stony Desert proper
consists of many patches, but probably none will be
found to be very extensive. The stout hearts of the
explorers quailed but for a moment. Be the consequence
what it might, they determined to go forward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and the first night found them encamped in the
desert without a drop of water. Their only hope of
safety consisted in expeditious travel out of this
scene of desolation. It was found to extend 50 miles,
and when the party reached the other side, they were
in a condition which can be more easily conceived
than described. Here again they entered upon a
similar belt of sand-ridges such as they had found
flanking the Stony Desert on the other side. These,
unhappily, were succeeded by another region of sand,
utterly destitute of water. Their sufferings, which
had formerly been great, were now intolerable. It
became apparent that further progress was impracticable,
and it was just a question whether retreat
was possible&mdash;certainly it could not remain so much
longer with such heat and drought as were then
prevailing. The necessity of retreat was thus forced
upon them, but it was a very painful one. They had
now travelled more than 400 miles from the dep√¥t
(and such travelling!) and could they only have
advanced another 150 miles they would have pitched
their camp in the centre of Australia, the darling
object of so many heroic sacrifices. Their reluctance
to yield to this last dictate of necessity was extreme.
A member of the expedition has pictured Sturt as he
sat on one of the sand dunes with his face buried in
his hands for a whole hour, while the struggle was
going on in his own mind. It was not in nature,
indeed, to yield without a mighty conflict. But
inexorable necessity had to be obeyed notwithstanding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and thus valuable lives were saved. This
was his second repulse from the centre of Australia.
Nothing is more admirable in the character of Sturt
than his magnanimity under adversity. However
keenly he may have felt his disappointment, his mind
retained its accustomed tranquillity, and during the
retreat he went on laying down the bearings of his
route for the guidance of others who might follow
and obtain the palm he had been compelled to
resign. He reached the dep√¥t, where he had left the
remainder of his party, on the 2nd October, 1845,
having been absent seven weeks and travelled more
than 800 miles.</p>

<p>After a short period of rest and refreshment this
chivalrous explorer, who amid all his heavy misfortunes
was certainly <i>tenax propositi</i>, to the surprise
and regret of his party conceived the design of
making one more attempt to reach the centre of
Australia. He now determined on trying the line of
the creek he had formerly discovered, and now called
after Strzelecki, in the hope of its giving him sufficient
northing to bring him within a practicable
distance of the object for which the expedition had
been sent. Strzelecki's Creek was found to answer his
purpose so long as it lasted, and at its termination
led to the discovery of another of much greater
importance. To this new river Sturt gave the name
of Cooper's Creek, after a distinguished South Australian
judge. Unfortunately it flowed nearly east
and west, and, therefore, had to be abandoned in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 94]</a></span>
prosecution of a northern route. Leaving the plains
which extended for some distance from the banks of
Cooper's Creek, Sturt again encountered the ominous
sand-ridges of which he had had sufficient experience
on the former journey, and these being traversed, his
hard fate again landed him on the edge of the Stony
Desert. His destiny seemed ever mocking him with
deserts, but this was the last he ever discovered.
Having swept the unvarying horizon long and
patiently with his telescope, and finding no break in
the terrible monotony, he turned back for the third
and last time from the effort to accomplish the dream
of his life. After so many magnanimous sacrifices,
he finally and for ever waived the palm of reaching
the centre of the continent, which, sixteen years later,
was won by a member of the same expedition, Mr.
J. M'Douall Stuart, whose march to the coveted spot
reads in comparison like a holiday excursion. The
party now fell back upon Cooper's Creek, which was
traced upwards for a considerable distance. It is a
remarkable circumstance that Sir Thomas Mitchell
was exploring its upper waters about the same time.
But nothing could be more diverse than the two
descriptions of the same stream. Mitchell's is quite
<i>couleur de rose</i>, and Sturt's has probably been tinged
with the effect of his own misfortunes. While the
one gave it the name of Cooper's Creek, as already
noticed, the other called it the Victoria, after the
Queen. This was most unfortunate, as there is another
Victoria River on the west coast. However, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 95]</a></span>
designations are now generally superseded by the
native name of Barcoo.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to enter into details respecting the
homeward expedition. The outward track was followed
as closely as possible to Laidley Ponds, and
thence to Adelaide. The water was rapidly drying
up, and the retreat had to be conducted like the forced
marches of an army. The men were nearly all ill,
more or less, and some of them, being unable to walk,
had to be carried long distances. Latterly, the leader
of the expedition seems to have been the chief sufferer.
Long exposure to the glaring reflection of the sun on
the sandy wastes had ruined his eyesight, and not
long afterwards he became permanently blind. Even
now his constitution was completely shattered, and he
had to be laid on a bed of leaves and conveyed from
the interior in a cart, from which sufferings he never
fully recovered. Such was Charles Sturt, after fifteen
months' wanderings in the deserts of our country;
and henceforth this heroic and much-enduring man
disappeared from the stage of Australian history, of
which he had been long a distinguished ornament.
He retired on a pension of ¬£600 from the South
Australian Legislature, and died at Cheltenham in
1869.</p>

<h3>EYRE'S ADVENTUROUS JOURNEY ALONG THE GREAT
AUSTRALIAN BIGHT.</h3>


<p>Edward John Eyre, the son of a Yorkshire clergyman,
was born in the year 1815. A youthful passion
for the heroic led him to chose the military profession;
but, having failed to obtain a commission, he turned
his attention to the colonies, and came to Sydney in
1833, with the slender capital of ¬£400. Part of this
sum was spent in obtaining colonial experience, in
which he graduated so high as to become the leader
in a new Australian enterprise. The newly founded
settlements of Port Phillip (subsequently Victoria)
and South Australia had created a great demand for
stock, all of which had hitherto been carried by sea,
and, on reaching their destination, were sold at famine
prices. Young Eyre conceived the practicability of
an overland route, and proceeded to prove it to a
demonstration. In the first of these journeys he took
1,000 sheep and 600 head of cattle from the Monaro
district, in New South Wales, to Adelaide, in South
Australia, by way of the Murray River, and reaped a
handsome pecuniary reward in the sale of the stock.
Smaller men followed in the wake of this born
adventurer, making overlanding the most paying
game in Australia, till a glut was produced in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 97]</a></span>
southern markets. Success having followed Eyre in
the new path his enterprise had struck out, he was
soon in possession of sufficient funds to begin squatting
on his own account. He purchased the station
"Murrundi," on the Lower Murray, where he resided for
several years, acting also as magistrate and protector
of the aborigines. Occasionally, too, he varied the
monotony of bush life by feats of exploration into the
unknown territory, thus keeping alive the spirit of
adventure, and unconsciously qualifying himself for
the romantic enterprise which will transmit his name
to distant posterity.</p>

<p>Up to the year 1840 Western Australia remained
completely isolated from the other colonies, and could
be approached only by sea. But as that country was
now being extensively occupied, it was of great
importance also to the settlers in the south to find an
overland route from Adelaide, and it was believed the
time had come when a successful effort could be made.
The obstacles which barred the way were enormous,
and for that epoch insuperable; but so little were
they suspected by the South Australians that the
proposed journey was regarded as a pleasure excursion,
and it was considered advisable to lighten the
expense of the expedition by sending over a quantity
of stock with the pioneer explorers! The one man
who could correct this public delusion was Mr. Eyre,
for he knew enough of the outlying country to feel
safe in predicting the failure of the proposed undertaking.
By both speech and pen he laboured to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 98]</a></span>
oppose the misguided enthusiasm, and succeeded in
preventing a certain waste of treasure and a very
probable sacrifice of human life. But it was far
from his desire to see so much ardour for exploration
run to waste, and now that the colony was in high
feather for discovery, Eyre made a successful effort to
divert it into what he considered a more profitable
channel. Very little was yet known of the country
to the north. Why not strike out in this direction
now, and make a bold attempt to reach the centre of
Australia from the city of Adelaide? One argument
alone was sufficient, and with it Eyre prevailed. He
offered to be the leader of the expedition, providing
one-third of its expense from his own pocket. Nothing
remained now but to get on with the preparations.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, 1840, a well-provisioned
party consisting of eight persons, with Eyre in
command, supported by two other Europeans, Scott
and Baxter, left Adelaide under favourable auspices,
and in high hopes of exploring a large portion of the
interior if more cherished results should prove
unattainable; but, as the event proved, only to meet
with crushing disappointment. Lake Torrens was as
yet very imperfectly known, and Eyre, misled by
refraction, conceived it to be an immense sheet of
water in the shape of a horse-shoe, within the bend
of which he supposed the expedition was being
entrapped. The curve, in reality, was described by a
chain of mud lakes partly covered with water, and
partly encrusted with salt. Passages are now found,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 99]</a></span>
at intervals, between these mud lagoons, but Eyre
had not the good luck to hit on one of them.
Aroused by the energy of despair, he next determined
to round this impenetrable barrier, and struck out to
the eastward, for an isolated peak which he called
Mount Hopeless. The name corresponded to the
reality, for the outlook from its summit revealed
nothing but a barren and burning desert, which
forced the expedition to fall back by a western route
to the southern coast.</p>

<p>Headquarters now remained for some time at
Streaky Bay, on the eastern shoulder of the Great
Australian Bight. Taking a subdivision of the party,
he again and again endeavoured to round the head of
the Bight in the hope of finding better country,
which would open a favourable route towards the
interior. Here, too, his expectations were baffled in
this latter respect, and even Eyre had to abandon his
pet project in utter despair. But he was of too
dauntless a temperament to brook the idea of returning
to Adelaide without accomplishing something
worthy of remembrance. His next move was competent
only to a madman or a hero. It was a serious
attempt to lead an expedition from the encampment
on Fowler's Bay to King George's Sound, along the
Great Australian Bight, a journey of more than 1,500
miles over the worst country under the sun. He
proposed to proceed with his present party unbroken,
if Governor Gawler would allow the government
cutter to advance to Cape Arid, a sort of half-way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 100]</a></span>
station, and there await the expedition, with a supply
of provisions. The Governor refused the use of the
vessel in connection with so romantic a proposal,
except for the purpose of bringing the entire party
back to Adelaide, and so putting an end to what he
must be excused for regarding as a mad freak. But
Eyre was a man born to lead, not to be led, and
determined to stick to his purpose, with help or
without it. Yet, being conscious of the extreme peril
that lay on the very face of the undertaking, he
resolved to risk the sacrifice of no European's life but
his own, and made preparations to send home Scott
and Baxter in the cutter. Baxter, an old and faithful
servant, who had been overseer on Eyre's station,
persisted in clinging to his master, whether for life or
death. And, alas! it was for the latter. The party,
as thus reduced, consisted of only two white men and
three black boys, one being an old favourite named
Wylie. A few horses and sheep, together with a
limited supply of provisions, made up the sum total of
the expedition.</p>

<p>Never before was an enterprise of such overwhelming
difficulty engaged in by reasonable men.
This section of the southern coast was yet scarcely
known. The navigators Nuyts and Flinders had
cruised over its waters, gazing with mysterious awe
on its weather-beaten cliffs, rising to the precipitous
height of 400 or even 600 feet above the water. At
intervals along the base the waves had undermined
this Titanic sea-wall, causing it to fall in many a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 101]</a></span>
yawning breach, the <i>debris</i> of which completely
obstructed the passage between the rocks and the sea
in the few places where such a convenience might
have been previously possible. The crown of these
cliffs had not yet been trodden by the white man's
foot, and the reports of the sparse aborigines were
enough to freeze the ardour of the most adventurous
in the heroic age of Australian exploration. On this
border-land of earth and sea contending winds had
deposited the dust particles borne on their wings, and
rolled them together in heaps, to be met with at long
and dreary intervals. These sand-hills, resting on a
limestone formation, retained at their base a small
supply of water, to be reached only by painstaking,
and often painful, digging. For the greater part of the
way no other water was to be found on this barren
and inhospitable region of parched-up Australia.</p>

<p>From Cape Adieu, where leave had been taken of
the cutter and its passengers, to the first stage at the
head of the Bight, the difficulties were manageable&mdash;for
this part of the route had been traversed and
supplies hidden for future use&mdash;but, this over, they
had to be faced in all their appalling magnitude. The
sand-hills were found to be so far apart that it was
impossible to bring the stock from the one to the
other without intermediate supply. When the sheep,
and sometimes the horses, could travel no further, one
or two of the parties had to be left in charge while
others pushed forward in search of water, and then
returned with what supply they could bring, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 102]</a></span>
animals were driven on to the station. The discouragements
were infinite and the labour superhuman.
Eyre alone was equal to the strain, and he
owed it more to his indomitable spirit than to his
natural strength. It was a sore trial to perceive even
Baxter to be giving way and wishing to return; but
as this seemed to threaten certain death, he kept to
his resolution, and persevered against all hope of a
successful issue, so desperate had the aspect of affairs
now become. The few sheep having dwindled away
with ominous rapidity, it had become necessary to
kill several of the horses and eat them, although they
furnished little but skin and bone. Matters having
come to extremities, the baggage had to be reduced to
the smallest proportions, and most of the valuables
were thrown away in the wilderness to lighten the
burden of carriage. Their sufferings from want
of water now became indescribable. Man and beast
were compelled to travel three or four days without
getting a mouthful. With only one exception, none
had been found but in the sand-hills for the distance
of 800 miles, and how hard it was to reach it there
has already been described. Even the dew on the
sparse patches of grass was put in requisition, as may
be learned from the following extract from the journal
of the expedition:&mdash;"Leaving the overseer to search
for the horses, which had strayed, I took a sponge and
went to try to collect some of the dew which was
hanging in spangles on the grass and shrubs. Brushing
these with the sponge, I squeezed it, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 103]</a></span>
saturated, into a quart-pot, which in an hour's time I
filled with water. The native boys were occupied in
the same way, and, by using a handful of fine grass
instead of a sponge, they collected about a quart
among them. Having taken the water to the camp
and made it into tea, we divided it amongst the party,
and never was a meal more truly relished, although
we ate the last morsel of bread we had with us, and
none knew when we might again enjoy either a drink of
water or a mouthful of bread. We had now demonstrated
the practicability of collecting water from the
dew. I had often heard from the natives that they
were in the habit of practising this plan, but had
never before actually witnessed its adoption."</p>

<p>But the climax was yet to come. To privations
and difficulties the crime of treachery and murder was
now to be added. Two of the blacks proved unfaithful,
and shot the overseer, Baxter, in cold blood,
apparently for the purpose of deserting with as much
of the provisions as they could lay hands on, perhaps
after the murder of the leader himself. The words
in which Eyre describes the anguish of his situation
exceed the highest efforts of tragedy, and show how
fact may become stranger than fiction. "The night
was cold, and the wind blowing hard from the south-west,
whilst scud and nimbus were passing very
rapidly by the moon. The horses fed tolerably well,
but rambled a good deal, threading in and out among
the many belts of scrub which intersected the grassy
openings, until I scarcely knew exactly where our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 104]</a></span>
camp was, the fires having apparently expired some
time ago. It was now half-past ten, and I headed the
horses back in the direction in which I thought the
camp lay, that I might be ready to call the overseer
to relieve me at eleven. Whilst thus engaged and
looking steadfastly around among the scrub to see if
I could anywhere detect the embers of our fires, I
was startled by a sudden flash, followed by the report
of a gun, not a quarter of a mile away from me.
Imagining that the overseer had mistaken the hour of
the night, and not being able to find me or the horses
had taken that method to attract my attention, I
immediately called out, but no answer was returned.
I got alarmed, and, leaving the horses, hurried up
towards the camp as rapidly as I could. About a
hundred yards from it I met the King George's Sound
native (Wylie) running towards me, and in great
haste and alarm, crying out, 'Oh, Massa! oh, Massa,
come here!' but could gain no information from him
as to what had occurred. Upon reaching the encampment,
which I did in about five minutes after the
shot was fired, I was horror-struck to find my poor
overseer lying on the ground weltering in his blood,
and in the last agonies of death. Glancing hastily
around the camp, I found it deserted by the two
younger native boys, whilst the scattered fragments
of our baggage, which I left carefully piled
under the oilskin, lay thrown about in wild disorder,
and at once revealed the cause of the harrowing scene
before me. Upon raising the body of my faithful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 105]</a></span>
but ill-fated follower, I found that he was beyond all
human aid; he had been shot through the left breast
with a ball; the last convulsions of death were upon
him, and he expired almost immediately after our
arrival. The frightful, the appalling truth now burst
upon me that I was alone in the desert. He who
had faithfully served me for many years, who had
followed my fortunes in adversity and prosperity,
who had accompanied me in all my wanderings, and
whose attachment to me had been his sole inducement
to remain with me in this last and, to him, alas! fatal
journey, was now no more. For an instant, I was
almost tempted to wish that it had been my fate
instead of his. The horrors of my situation glared
upon me in such startling reality as for an instant
almost to paralyze the mind. At the dead hour of
night, in the wildest and most inhospitable wastes of
Australia, with the fierce wind raging in unison with
the scene of violence before me, I was left with a
single native, whose fidelity I could not rely upon,
and who for aught I knew might be in league with
the other two, who were perhaps even now lurking
about with the view of taking away my life as they
had done that of the overseer. Three days had
passed away since we left the last water, and it was
very doubtful when we might find any more. Six
hundred miles of country had to be traversed before
I could hope to obtain the slightest aid or assistance
of any kind, whilst I knew not that a single drop of
water or an ounce of flour had been left by these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 106]</a></span>
murderers from a stock that had previously been so
small. Though years have now passed away since
the enactment of this tragedy, the dreadful horrors
of that time and scene are recalled before me with
frightful vividness, and make me shudder when I
think of them. A lifetime was crowded into those
few short hours, and death alone may blot out the
impression they produced."</p>

<p>To give decent burial to the body of a friend
whom death only could separate would have been a
melancholy satisfaction, but even this slight tribute
of affection was denied by the situation. No grave
could be dug, for sheet-rock, stretching far and wide,
formed the adamantine pavement of this horrible
place. Wrapt in a blanket for its winding-sheet, the
corpse was left in this lonely wilderness, where it lay
undisturbed till it was stumbled on quite recently by
the district mailman. On a calmer view of the
position, Eyre discovered that the ruffians had left
him only forty pounds of flour, a little tea and sugar,
and four gallons of water. Such was the provision
for two men against a journey of 600 miles!
Nothing, however, could be gained by delay in this
awful scene, and every consideration counselled an
immediate departure&mdash;most of all, the knowledge that
the two murderers were skulking in the neighbourhood
with the probable design of taking Eyre's life.
A start was made without further loss of time.
Another horse was killed for food, but the animal
having been poor and sickly, its flesh did not agree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 107]</a></span>
with them, and ill health supervened. When thus
brought face to face with the last extremity, a sudden
vision of deliverance nearly overwhelmed them with
joy. Coming unexpectedly on an opening in the
Bight, first a boat and then a ship at anchor rushed
upon the view. A closer acquaintance proved the
apparition to be a French whaling-vessel, under
the command of Captain Rossiter, whose name is
fittingly perpetuated in the same little bay. The
unlooked-for visitors were hospitably entertained
and lodged for twelve days in the ship, till they
were sufficiently recruited for the remainder of
the journey. With renewed strength, and a fresh
supply of provisions, the march through the desert
was once more resumed, for the indomitable explorer
would not even yet abandon the project. Though
hardship had now lost its sting, more difficulties had
yet to be encountered than might have been expected,
but they were of a different kind from the preceding.
Water became only too plentiful, for a wet season had
set in, and the travellers had often to wade rather than
to walk. But the end of this terrible journey drew on
apace. To their unspeakable joy the mountains on
the further side of King George's Sound began to
loom in the distance, and Wylie, who was a native
of that district, now for the first time showed some
confidence in his leader, whom he never expected
to bring him back to his home. The welcome
sight, in truth, inspired both the black and the white
man with fresh life; for they had to make only one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 108]</a></span>
more effort, and, this over, their weary feet found rest
in the hospitable settlement of Albany. The heroic
endurance displayed during this journey stands
without a parallel in history, but it led to nothing but
a barren triumph over stupendous difficulties. Had
Eyre kept further inland he would have found a
better route and opened up a more profitable country.
This discovery had to wait for another and more
fortunate explorer. The present expedition, by
hugging the shore, travelled over a tract of country
that was seen to be utterly useless for the wants of
civilization. So patent was this fact to Mr. Eyre
himself that he justified the publication of his
narrative by the strange argument that no one had
traversed this wilderness before and he was perfectly
sure none would ever do it again.</p>

<p>Henceforward Edward John Eyre was known to
fame&mdash;but not to fortune. Being subsequently
appointed Governor of Jamaica, he fell heir to an
upheaval of disorder, which culminated in open
rebellion. This insurrection Eyre put down with an
iron hand. Some accused him of needless severity,
while others justified his conduct as an act of
imperative necessity. The hero-worshipper, the late
Thomas Carlyle, defended him bravely, and was
seconded by many sympathizers of less note, who
came to the rescue with pen and purse. This perilous
journey of former years was justly pleaded in Mr.
Eyre's favour, but his friends weakened their case by
confounding the Great Australian Bight with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Gulf of Carpentaria! Though exonerated by a
commission of inquiry, the Governor was recalled, and
for four years thereafter harassed by a bitter prosecution,
which he probably found harder to endure than
his terrible journey on the Great Australian Bight.</p>

<h3>SIR THOMAS MITCHELL'S FOUR EXPEDITIONS.</h3>


<p>This eminent explorer was a native of Scotland,
having been born at Craigend, Stirlingshire, in 1792.
He chose the army for his profession, and served
under Wellington, in the Peninsular war, from 1808
till its close. His career appears to have been a most
creditable one. He had a hand in laying out the
famous Torres Vedras lines, which gave a fatal check
to the ambition of Napoleon. Mitchell left the service
with the rank of Major, receiving also a medal and
five clasps. Having emigrated to New South Wales,
he was appointed Surveyor-General, an office which
had fallen vacant by the death of Mr. John Oxley.
Being an active and adventurous man, he threw himself,
heart and soul, into the cause of exploration.
Mitchell was the most successful of all the explorers,
and had the good fortune to open up the magnificent
territory which now forms the colony of Victoria.
He was the leader of four great expeditions, which
shall now be briefly related in the order of their
occurrence.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Among the notabilities of the old convict days there
are not many who will be longer remembered than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 111]</a></span>
George Clarke, better known, in his own time, as
"George the Barber." This runaway convict having
taken to bushranging and cattle-stealing as naturally
as the duck makes for the water, had also
shown himself an adept in the arts which elude the
detective. Passing beyond the bounds of settlement,
which had now extended 300 miles to the north
of Sydney, he fixed his headquarters and erected a
stockyard for stolen cattle on the further side of the
Liverpool Plains. Here he abjured the last vestige of
civilization and associated himself with the aborigines,
having become a conformist in the first degree. He
doffed every article of clothing, blackened his skin,
and even scarified his flesh, in order to appear a naked
savage pure and simple. But the compliment does
not seem to have been reciprocated. He was successful,
indeed, in gaining the hearts of two black gins,
who followed him and his fortunes as far as fate
would permit; but the sable brotherhood did not take
kindly to the intruder. Hearing he was wanted by
the police to answer for his cattle-stealing propensities,
they lent a hand to the progress of civilization,
and delivered up this spurious brother, who was forthwith
lodged in Bathurst gaol. Of all the men in
the world this runaway convict, who had enjoyed the
sweets of liberty, both in the savage and the civilized
life, would be the last to brook the restraints of confinement,
and it is no surprise to find him casting
about for the means of deliverance. The most
feasible way of accomplishing his object undoubtedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 112]</a></span>
lay in the plan which his native cunning led him to
adopt. Popular excitement was then at fever heat on
the exploration of the unknown territory. Sturt had
recently returned from an expedition in which he
had opened up more than 2,000 miles of country on
the lower Murrumbidgee and Murray rivers, and had,
consequently, given a great impulse to the exploring
enterprise. Now was the time for "George the
Barber" to tell his secret from Bathurst gaol. Having
passed beyond a range of mountains to the northward
of the Liverpool Plains, so his story ran, he had
discovered a magnificent river which the natives
called the "Kindur." It traversed a splendid country,
was itself navigable throughout, and having followed
its course on two different occasions, it led him
through the heart of Australia to the north coast,
without ever turning to the south. Men readily
believe what they wish to be true, and such a river as
here described was the very thing wanted in order to
open up a waterway to Carpentaria. The story
accordingly commanded general attention, and most
people believed it contained a sufficient degree of
verisimilitude to warrant the expense of a special
exploring expedition to put it to the proof.</p>

<p>Major Mitchell was now in the place where he
would feel the impulse for exploration with all its
force, and so fell in most heartily with the popular
excitement. Putting the most favourable construction
upon the "Barber's" story, and believing that it
contained, at least, a substratum of truth, he expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 113]</a></span>
his readiness to go in search of the "Kindur," provided
the Acting-Governor, Sir Patrick Lindsay, would
supply the necessary outfit. This request was readily
granted, and Major Mitchell left Sydney on the 24th
November, 1831, to run a wild-goose chase or make a
great discovery. It was not necessary to organize the
expedition before starting, as the country was now
settled so far to the north, and final arrangements
were accordingly postponed till a nearer approach was
made to the unknown land. The early part of the
journey was pretty much in the style of a pleasure
excursion. The would-be explorer of the "Kindur"
passed northward to Parramatta, where he was shown,
as a great novelty, the first olive-tree planted in the
colony. The Hawkesbury was crossed at Wiseman's
Ferry, and in due course the Wollombi, a tributary
of the Hunter, was reached. Soon after he proceeded
to make up his party, which, when completed,
consisted of two gentlemen volunteers, named White
and Finch, and fifteen convicts, all of whom, the
leader avers, were ready to face fire and water in
the hope of regaining that liberty which they had
forfeited by transgressing the laws of their country.
The expedition having been thus organized and
supplied with every requisite, moved northward,
passing near Muswellbrook, and crossing the Hunter
without meeting with anything particularly worthy
of notice, until they came upon the burning hill of
Wingen, which attracted their attention as a remarkable
curiosity. It is not a volcano, but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 114]</a></span>
mountain of coal or shale, on fire underneath, which
sends forth volumes of smoke through the rents in
its surface. On the 5th of December the ascent
of the Liverpool Range was gained and a commanding
view of the plains obtained. This fine tract
of country had been discovered by Oxley, explored
by Cunningham, and was now found to be largely
occupied by pioneer squatters. The Peel River was
struck at Wallamoul, about two miles above the spot
where Oxley had first crossed it, and here was found
the last station, owned by a squatter of the name of
Brown, and containing 1,600 head of cattle. The
route of the expedition was now directed towards the
lower course of the river, where it becomes known
under the native name of the Namoi. The euphonious
"Namoi" was music to the ear of Mitchell, for the
bushranger had spoken of a river of this name, and
was the first to make it known under this designation.
The Major was gratified to find this slight confirmation
of the story that had brought him so far from
home, and hastened to make it known to the
authorities in Sydney, that "George the Barber"
might have the benefit; and a real benefit it was, for
it saved him from the gallows. Having failed to
obtain his liberty when his information was acted on,
this noted criminal, in his desperation, succeeded in
sawing the irons off his feet, and in this way made good
his escape from incarceration. But the law has long
arms, and the "Barber," being again clutched within
their iron grasp, was condemned to suffer the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 115]</a></span>
penalty, from which doom he was saved by the
timely arrival of Mitchell's letter.</p>

<p>The <i>terra incognita</i> now was entered upon, and the
first object that drew the attention of the explorers
was the old stockyard of the bushranger, which,
doubtless, was too near a neighbour of Brown's cattle
station. About two miles distant the Pic of Tangulda
rose to a conspicuous elevation. This was one of the
landmarks of the prisoner's tale. The "Kindur" was
to be reached by proceeding north-east, over a range
of mountains which were visible from this position.
Mitchell directed his march accordingly; but, after
several days of distressing travel, found the mountains
to be impracticable, and was compelled to return
to his former camp. Now, for the first time, grave
doubts began to fill his mind regarding the truth of
the convict's story. No other course being open, he
determined on launching a canvas boat and making
an effort to sail down the Namoi, to see what fortune
had in store for him. The attempt was scarcely well
made when it had to be abandoned, on account of
snags and shoals in the stream; but the change of
position was sufficient to make it apparent that the
mountain-chain which could not be crossed might now
be turned. This achievement was next successfully
accomplished, and Mitchell at length found himself on
their northern flanks. These mountains bore the
native name of "Nundawar," and, in respect of their
outward appearance, had been described sufficiently
well by the bushranger. But now came the crucial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 116]</a></span>
test of his truth or falsehood. According to the same
story the "Kindur" was the first river to be reached
beyond these mountains, and, one way or other, the
question could not now have long to wait for an answer.
A river of some kind was the very thing wanted by
the explorers, for they had passed through a rugged
and waterless country. Were they now, at last, to
drop upon the "Kindur?" Such a discovery would
have been doubly welcome, for it would have relieved
them from present distress, and proved the goal of a
journey which, it was hoped, would place the laurel
crown on the brow of the Major and sound the trumpet
of freedom to his fifteen convict attendants. The 9th
of January arrived, and this day was destined to feast
the eyes of the weary travellers with the sudden
appearance of a noble river, broader and deeper than
the Namoi, and one of which Australia might well be
proud. Was this the "Kindur" at last? Not for a
moment. It flowed in the wrong direction, and lost
much of its volume in its downward course; and
Mitchell soon satisfied himself that it was nothing else
than one of the many tributaries of the Darling. In
fact, it had not the merit of an original discovery.
This was the Gwydir, which had been crossed long
ago by Allan Cunningham. Mitchell turned from it
in disgust and made for the north, in the hope of
hitting upon some discovery really worthy of the
expedition. He was rewarded, in so far that he
discovered an important river, called the Karaula by
the natives, but now better known as the Macintyre.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Further exploration proved this stream to be one of
the head-waters of the Darling, and, therefore, useless
for the purpose of one who was seeking a water-channel
to the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>

<p>Mitchell's only hope of retrieving himself now lay
in crossing the Darling, and making an inroad upon
the interior; but the feasibility of this course was
suspended on a doubtful contingency. Fearing his
provisions would not hold out so long as would be
necessary, he had, before leaving the Peel River, sent
Finch back to the Hunter district for fresh supplies,
and the future of the expedition depended on
this forlorn hope. Finch returned about the time
expected, but only to bring a tale of disaster instead
of a supply of provisions. All had gone well till
they had got beyond the Liverpool Plains, when
water began to fail them. Finch had gone on to
search the country in advance, and on returning
found his party murdered and the camp sacked.
This was a crowning calamity. Mitchell, of course,
now saw that it would be impossible to proceed
further, and it was even very doubtful whether they
could return in safety. A wet season was setting in,
and 200 miles of flooded country lay between them
and their homes. Their return, accordingly, was conducted
after the manner of a retreating army, and
the similitude was all the more striking because they
were harassed by hostile tribes of aborigines. But
the settled districts were soon reached, and there was
no further difficulty in making Port Jackson. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 118]</a></span>
was, indeed, a disappointment to the authorities, as it
had been to Mitchell, to find they had been duped by
"George the Barber." Yet the expedition had opened
up a vast extent of pastoral country, and on the
whole was fairly successful as an exploring enterprise.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Major Mitchell, full of enterprise, was again in the
field of discovery in 1835. His failure in the affair
of the "Kindur" had not discouraged him, and the
experience incidentally gained was an excellent
preparation for the more arduous work of the future.
Public attention had again turned from the north to
the westward of the colony, and another attempt was
to be made to lift the veil which still shrouded so
much of the interior. At the request of the British
Government, Mitchell willingly undertook the conduct
of an expedition to the Bogan and the Darling, in
order to set at rest some geographical problems which
were still attached to the course of these rivers.</p>

<p>More than any of the other explorers, Mitchell
believed in large and liberally equipped expeditions,
here probably erring by excess, and he resolved that
the present should not be deficient in either respect.
The party, all told, consisted of twenty-four persons&mdash;Major
Mitchell as leader, Richard Cunningham, brother
to the more celebrated Allan Cunningham, botanist
and explorer, a young surveyor of the name of Larmer,
and twenty-one convict servants, nine of whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 119]</a></span>
had been connected with the "Kindur" search. The
material resources consisted of two boats, several
drays, a good contingent of horses, bullocks, and sheep,
together with an ample supply of provisions. The
start was made from Parramatta on the 9th of March;
but the work of exploration proper did not commence
till they reached Buree, a frontier station near Mount
Canobolas, about 170 miles from Sydney.</p>

<p>Having taken his observations from the summit of
this mountain, Mitchell fixed his direction on the
bearing of 60¬∞ west of north, judging he would thus
find a practicable route, and strike the Bogan somewhere
in its upper course. The result answered his
expectation. On the 13th of April he crossed the
Goobang, a tributary of the Lachlan, and in two days
more the Bogan was reached. Here a most lamentable
event occurred, which cast its dark shadow over the
whole of their future wanderings. Richard Cunningham,
the botanist of the expedition, had been too much
in the practice of leaving the party for the "pursuit
of flora," and now failed to find his way back to the
camp. For a long time no trace of the missing man
could be found; but after a most diligent search tracks
both of himself and of his horse were observed. These
were followed for 70 miles, but to no purpose; distressing
suspicions also began to arise, pointing to foul
play on the part of the natives. But nothing definite
could be arrived at, and after a fortnight's fruitless
searching and tracking, the expedition was sorrowfully
compelled to hold on its course. Subsequently it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 120]</a></span>
decisively ascertained that Cunningham, ready to
perish of hunger and thirst, had sought refuge with
the blacks, by four of whom he was savagely murdered
in his sleep. A full investigation was made by
Captain Zouch, who had been despatched from Sydney
on this business. He succeeded in discovering the
dead man's bones, which were decently interred, and
a suitable monument was erected on the scene of this
diabolical murder. Three of the perpetrators of the
crime were also arrested; but, through the remissness
of the constable in charge, two of them managed to
escape.</p>

<p>The explorers still kept the line of the Bogan,
moving off and on to its banks according as the want
of water, or the desire to cut off an observed elbow,
more particularly directed their course. By the 20th
of May the expedition had arrived at the Pink
Hills, where the best grazing land was met with since
the commencement of the journey. From this point
Oxley's Table-land, a well-known landmark with
former explorers, was plainly visible. On the 25th
they were gratified by the discovery of the junction of
the Bogan and the Darling rivers. The former of
these, though only now brought into prominent notice,
had been known to exist for many years past. It was
first discovered by Hamilton Hume in connection with
Sturt's expedition to the Macquarie, and was then
called New Year's Creek. Much later its upper course
had been traced by a Mr. Dixon for 67 miles, and the
exploration of its whole length was thus completed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Major Mitchell in 1835. The Bogan was found to
head from the Hervey Range, and this explorer had
the good fortune to discover its termination in the
Darling River after a sinuous course of 250 miles. At
best it is only a third or fourth-class river; but, as it
traverses a tolerably good grazing country, its basin
has become fully occupied for squatting purposes.</p>

<p>The junction of these two rivers now became an
important landmark for the remainder of the journey,
and the place has ever since played a conspicuous
part in the opening up and settlement of the back
country. The position consists of an elevated plateau
overlooking a reach of the river a mile and a half in
length, with a hill situated near a sharp turn at the
lower end of the reach. Having now travelled 500
miles from Sydney, the whole party were in need of
rest, and Mitchell wisely resolved on fixing a permanent
dep√¥t here. Intending to leave some of his men
while engaged in the exploration of the lower course
of the river, he considered it an act of prudence to
enclose the dep√¥t with a stockade, as he was not yet
sufficiently acquainted with the natives of the Darling
to trust them with any degree of confidence. A
stockade was accordingly constructed of rough logs,
and to this, his first attempt at bush fortification, he
gave the name of Fort Bourke, in compliment to the
Governor of the colony. Such was the beginning of
Bourke, the now famous centre of our back country
settlement, and the present terminus of the Great
Western Railway of New South Wales.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 122]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Two boats, as already noticed, had been brought all
the way from Sydney as part of the furniture of the
expedition, and the time seemed to have arrived for
their being turned to account. Being found to be in
perfect order they were forthwith christened the
<i>Discovery</i> and the <i>Resolution</i>, and launched on the
feeble current of the Darling. But hope was excited
to no purpose. The stream was too low and the
channel too much impeded to permit of navigation
even with the smallest craft, and the undertaking
was no sooner initiated than it had to be abandoned.
The former plan of the expedition had again to be
adopted, and the progress on the Darling was very
similar to what it had been on the Bogan. The
country traversed was found to be inferior as a
whole, only moderately valuable for pastoral purposes,
and nowhere adapted for agriculture to any
considerable extent. The incidents in this part of the
march were neither numerous nor striking. The
usual privations arising from want of water were
hardly known, as the explorers were never far from
the banks of a running stream which takes rank
among the foremost in Australia. The saltness of the
Darling, which proved such an inconvenience to
Sturt, was found by Mitchell to exist in a much
less degree, which shows that it must have arisen in
part from temporary causes.</p>

<p>If Mitchell's narrative is not so rich in thrilling
incidents as a sensational reader could have wished,
it is especially valuable as a record of the manners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and customs of the aborigines of those districts, as
they appeared to the eye of this intelligent and
observant traveller. Sometimes the description is so
life-like that we are almost cheated into the belief of
a visible reality, and it is impossible to be indifferent
to the exhibition, although the whole race has now
well-nigh passed away. The account is very generally
the reverse of Captain Sturt's, notwithstanding that
both of these eminent explorers must have had in
view substantially the same tribes. The judicious
reader will scarcely be disposed to agree unreservedly
with the Captain when he depicts them as the "most
miserable wretches" under the sun; neither will he
care to subscribe to the unqualified language of the
Major, who describes them as "happy" savages.
Truth seldom lies in extremes, and it is to the utmost
extreme that these authorities have gone, each in his
own way, as determined largely, perhaps, by his idiosyncrasies.
But the ethnologist, in particular, will
be thankful for the literary photograph of these
vanishing tribes which has been preserved in the
pages of this journal. The general reader, too, will
gladly observe some curious incidents of aboriginal
life in the interior of Australia. Mitchell specially
notices their adroitness in procuring the wild honey
of the bush. With great tact they first attached a
piece of light down to the bee, which, on being released,
would be sure to make straight for its nest.
To discover this secret, the blackfellow engaged in
hot pursuit; and, as his eye must be constantly on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the tiny insect, there would, of course, be frequent
tripping, and many an awkward fall on mother earth,
but the excitement was too great to permit of anything
short of a serious accident being noticed.
Another characteristic of the untutored savages was
their unwillingness to recognize the right of a white
man to hold property&mdash;it was all <i>meum</i> and no <i>tuum</i>
with them. For a while Mitchell tried to satisfy
them with liberal gifts, but giving only increased the
craving for more; and, what was worse, this liberality
on the part of the strangers began to be construed as
an indication of fear, and then the demands were more
impudently pressed than ever, which caused these
gifts, very properly, to cease altogether. And now
their thieving propensities broke out beyond all
bounds. Mitchell, like Apollo when Mercury filched
his bow, hardly knew whether to smile at the
adroitness of the thief or wax indignant at the loss
of his property. The cunning, craft, and success of
these barbarians went almost beyond credence. Not
only their hands were busy, but their very feet and
toes picked up the strangers' tools as they walked
over them. This latter practice was considered a real
accomplishment, and these savages seemed to have a
genuine contempt for the clumsy white-fellows who
could not use their "feet fingers." Barring this
troublesome propensity, the native tribes did not
cause much inconvenience to the expedition until
it got as far down the Darling as the Menindie
quarter, where a serious embroglio occurred, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 125]</a></span>
occasioned the shedding of aboriginal blood, and compelled
the explorers to desist from the further prosecution
of their journey. For this untoward event,
however, Mitchell was not to blame, and he regretted
he had to deal with convicts who were so difficult to
control. The local tribes having thus become exasperated,
a somewhat hasty retreat had to be made to
the central dep√¥t at Bourke, after 300 miles of the
Darling had been traversed, and little doubt being
left as to the remainder of the course till the junction
with the Murray.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The exploration and settlement of Victoria are
quite recent events in the history of Australia.
Important discoveries had been made on the seaboard
by Bass and Flinders in the close of the last and the
beginning of the present century; but they had no
effect in attracting population. Hume and Hovell
made an overland journey from Lake George to Port
Phillip in 1824, and brought to light an enormous
extent of fine territory near the southern coast; yet
the country remained unvisited by civilization for
another ten or twelve years. The original settlers
came from Tasmania, and were crowded out of the
old rather than attracted to the new home. The first
arrival seems to have been Edward Henty, who
effected a settlement at Portland Bay in 1834. Next
year John Batman, a native of Parramatta, who had
latterly resided in Tasmania, crossed Bass' Strait, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 126]</a></span>
fixed his headquarters on Indented Head. He
bargained with the natives for 600,000 acres of the
best land in exchange for a few blankets, knives, and
such-like commodities. He was followed in three
months' time by another of the name of Fawkner,
who, leaving "King John" in undisputed possession
of Indented Head, pitched his tent on the site of the
present city of Melbourne.</p>

<p>So much and nothing more was accomplished in
the settlement of the premier part of Australia, when
Major Mitchell crossed the Murray, and astonished
the world by a series of splendid discoveries in what
is now the famous colony of Victoria. The surprise
was the more telling on this account, that the revelations
resulted from a mere accident, and were aside
from the proper object of the expedition. The explorations
of Mitchell during the preceding year, which had
so largely supplemented the earlier discoveries of Sturt
on the Darling, very naturally excited public interest,
and created a desire for another expedition. The
River Darling was now pretty well known, with the
exception of about 200 miles from Menindie to the
junction with the Murray; but this latter river was
not yet explored higher up than its confluence with
the Murrumbidgee. These two objects being now to
be prosecuted, instructions were given to Major
Mitchell to organize another expedition; and into
this project, it is needless to say, the gallant Major
entered with his accustomed enthusiasm.</p>

<p>This expedition, numbering twenty-four persons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 127]</a></span>
amply provisioned, and destined to be the most
fortunate in the annals of exploration, left the
rendezvous near Mount Canobolas, on the outskirts of
settlement, on the 17th of March, 1836. The first
movement was made towards the old position at the
station of Buree, and then the route was followed to
the Lachlan. This river, as well as the Murrumbidgee,
which was reached on its lower course, had previously
been explored, and Mitchell had not much to add
that was new or striking. When he conceived he was
approaching the junction with the Murray, a dep√¥t
was formed beside an excellent sheet of water, to
which the name of Lake Stapylton was given.
Mitchell now divided his party, and, taking an escort,
struck out boldly for the Darling, which was still 100
miles distant. The usual difficulties of this kind of
travelling were encountered; but no one knew better
how to overcome them than this intrepid explorer.
The junction of the two chief rivers of Australia
was reached without loss of time&mdash;a position which
Mitchell says he recognized at once from a drawing
of Captain Sturt's. This compliment Sturt duly
acknowledged, remarking at the same time that it
was the only praise he had ever received from Sir
Thomas Mitchell, and he was afraid in this case it was
not very well deserved, as the drawing had been made
from a verbal description, and by an Edinburgh
clergyman who had never visited Australia! The
expedition was in great danger here from an
exasperated tribe of blacks who kept hanging upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the rear, and only waited for an opportunity to strike
a decisive blow. The aspect of matters was so
threatening that Mitchell resolved to abandon the
Darling, and fall back upon his alternative instructions,
which directed him to explore the upper
courses of the Murray. But the hostile tribe was
now between his own party and the dep√¥t, which was
100 miles away. Their number was rapidly increasing,
and their attitude growing more menacing every
day. A conflict could not be much longer averted,
and Mitchell, as a military man, was not willing to
allow the enemy to choose the most suitable time for
the attack. The men under his command appear to
have understood his intentions, and, without waiting
for orders, fired upon the tribe. Seven were killed,
and the multitude dispersed. It was a severe remedy,
but also a very effectual one, for this tribe never
attempted to cause them further annoyance.</p>

<p>On arriving at Lake Stapylton, Mitchell had the
satisfaction of finding that the dep√¥t had been unmolested,
a circumstance which relieved his mind from
considerable anxiety. The situation of the dep√¥t was
ascertained to be about ten miles from the junction of
the Murrumbidgee with the Murray. The latter was
crossed about a mile higher up, and the united expedition
started again with the intention of exploring this
interesting but unknown river. From this purpose
they were soon diverted by the discovery of an important
tributary, which seemed to lead them into
a better country than the Murray was likely to do.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 129]</a></span>
After losing or leaving this creek another was discovered,
of still greater importance, to which Mitchell
gave the name of the Loddon, from the marked
resemblance he thought it possessed to its namesake in
the old home. The country consisted of open downs,
and was the richest Mitchell had seen since he had
left Sydney. The plains were covered with anthistirium,
or kangaroo grass, which bent under the breeze
like a field of oats. The country was so lightly
timbered that the explorers could scarcely find fuel to
make a fire at several of their places of encampment.
This district also yielded many new and beautiful
plants, which greatly enriched the botanical collection.
Mitchell next ascended Mount Hope, a peak
which he so named because he expected to obtain a
view of the southern ocean from its summit. This
anticipation was not realized, but he enjoyed the
prospect of an unlimited reach of the class of country
he had already discovered. Another hill, called the
Pyramid, from its peculiar form, afforded also an
excellent view, and raised in Mitchell a transport of
joy. He could scarcely find words to describe the
magnificence of the scene, or express the delight he
felt on account of his own good fortune. "The scene,"
says he, "was different from anything I had ever
before witnessed, either in New South Wales, or elsewhere&mdash;a
land so inviting, and still without inhabitants.
As I stood, the first intruder on the sublime solitude
of these verdant plains, as yet untouched by flocks or
herds, I felt conscious of being the harbinger of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 130]</a></span>
changes there; for our steps would soon be followed
by the men and the animals for which it seemed to be
prepared." And again&mdash;"We had at length discovered
a country ready for the immediate reception of civilized
man, and fit to become eventually one of the great
nations of the earth. Unencumbered with too much
wood, yet possessing enough for all purposes; with an
exuberant soil under a temperate climate; bounded by
the sea-coast and mighty rivers, and watered abundantly
by streams from lofty mountains, this highly
interesting region lay before me, with all its features
new and untouched as they fell from the hands of the
Creator. Of this Eden it seemed I was the only
Adam; and it was indeed a sort of paradise to me,
permitted thus to be the first to explore its mountains
and streams&mdash;to behold its scenery&mdash;to investigate its
geological character&mdash;and finally, by my survey, to
develop those natural advantages all still unknown
to the civilized world, but yet certain to become at no
distant date of vast importance to a new people." No
prophet ever spoke truer words than these.</p>

<p>Soon after the Loddon, the Avoca and the Avon
Water were discovered. These streams irrigated the
same kind of country as that which had lately been
traversed. This tract was evidently an exception to
a rule which prevails throughout Australia. Good
land is usually poorly supplied with water, while well-watered
country is generally of little account in point
of fertility; but here for once was a district which
was equally distinguished for the abundance of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 131]</a></span>
streams and the excellence of its soil. The explorers
now took a direction more to the eastward, to reach
a lofty mountain-chain which appeared to be about
40 miles distant. This range forms a division between
the northern and the southern waters, and is really the
extremity of the coast range. Mitchell called these
the Grampians, from a supposed resemblance to a chain
of the same name in the Southern Highlands of Scotland.
Taking two of his best men, he next ascended
Mount William, a peak which rises 4,500 feet above
the sea and is the highest in the group. The weather
being unfavourable to the object in view, it was found
necessary to spend a miserably cold night upon its
summit, and the exposure permanently injured the
health of his two companions, who had followed the
explorer on three expeditions. An excellent view was
obtained at last, and another great landmark, Mount
Arapiles, was fixed upon as the next object toward
which they were to move. This was a bold and
isolated mountain lying westward of the range. Five
streams had to be crossed in passing over the intermediate
tract, and these were subsequently found to
unite and form the Wimmera. It was hoped this
important river would lead them to the ocean, but it
turned to the northward and flowed into the interior.
The tract of country next discovered presented a very
singular aspect. The surface, as far as the eye could
reach, was studded with lakes, which differed greatly
in size, but were circular in form. Their number
must have been prodigious; from one point of view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 132]</a></span>
no fewer than twenty-seven were counted. Most of
these circular lakes were brackish to the taste, and
many too salt to be fit for use.</p>

<p>The extremity of the Grampians had now been
reached, and the range was being successfully turned,
when the explorers saw before them a fine open
country, trending away towards the Southern Ocean.
The travelling was often heavy on the soft soil, and
they had to be satisfied with six miles a day as the
average rate of progress; nevertheless, the object in
view was being steadily accomplished, and no country
was ever traversed which was richer in the charming
incidents of travel. July the 31st was a red-letter day
for Mitchell, for it brought the welcome discovery of
a fine river, which led the party to the breakers of the
Southern Ocean. Its width was 120 feet, with an average
depth of 12 feet, and from first to last it continued
to flow through the most picturesque scenery. The
discoverer gave it the name of the Glenelg, in compliment
to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The
track of the expedition kept as closely as possible to
the left bank of the river, which with many windings
was found to be steadily making southward. One of
the most remarkable features of the Glenelg is the
number of feeders which it receives from both sides of
its basin. These occasionally flowed through deep
ravines, which made travelling difficult for the drays.
But the scenery is described as being exquisite.
Mitchell put the English language on the rack to
make it express his conception of the lovely scenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 133]</a></span>
which daily met his eye. Either of the valleys of the
Wando or the Wannon might well pass for a modern
Tempe. On the 12th of August the Rifle Range was
reached, and from one of the heights Mount Gambier,
near Cape Northumberland, was plainly seen, and this
was accepted as sufficient evidence that the sea could
not be very far distant. After receiving another
tributary, which was named the Stokes, the river,
affected also by the proximity to the ocean, became so
much increased in size as to induce Mitchell to launch
the boat which had been brought from Sydney. A
dep√¥t was accordingly formed at this position which
was called Fort O'Hare. Mitchell took two-thirds of
his men, and, after a few days' pleasant sail, landed
safely at the mouth of the Glenelg.</p>

<p>Before returning to Sydney it was thought advisable
to make a short journey to Portland Bay, for the
sake of examining the intervening country. In this
excursion various streams were discovered and
crossed, such as the Crawford, the Fitzroy, and the
Surrey; and the prominent peaks, Ellerslie, Clay, and
Kincaid, were ascended or sighted. The country
generally was swampy in the flats, and poor in the
higher grounds, until Portland was reached, where
the soil was found to be of the best possible description.
Here a great surprise was in store for the
explorers. They had stumbled by mere chance on the
newly-formed station of Edward Henty, from Tasmania,
who generously supplied them with provisions
for the homeward journey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 134]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Going still forward, Mitchell kept for a considerable
time on the southern fall of the range, in
the hope of finding a pass which would be generally
available. Such an opening he was fortunate enough
to discover, near the foot of Mount Byng, which he
safely passed through, barring an accident to his
travelling gear. While this was being repaired, he
made an excursion to a prominent height about 30
miles to the south, in the hope of being able to catch
a glimpse of Port Phillip, and thus enable him to
connect his surveys with this important position. To
this height he gave the name of Mount Macedon, and
from its summit was able to observe some of the
topographical features of what is now the site, or the
immediate neighbourhood, of Melbourne, and also
white sails or tents, which most likely were the
encampments of Batman and Fawkner, who had been
in their new home only a few months.</p>

<p>In returning, the Campaspe River was discovered,
and other tributaries of the Murray, made known by
Hume and Hovell, were crossed without difficulty.
The most serious obstacle was the passage of the
Murray; but it was passed without accident or mishap,
although it was 80 yards in width. Some rugged
country had to be encountered before the Murrumbidgee
was crossed. But this was the <i>ultimus labor</i>
of the expedition, for the settled territory had now
been reached. Mitchell accordingly reckoned this
outpost the termination of his journey; and it had
not been a short one. He had travelled over 2,400
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 135]</a></span>
miles of country, and was seven months in the bush.
But he had been more fortunate than any of his
predecessors; nor, indeed, has his success been eclipsed
to this day. For this splendid service he was
worthily rewarded with the honour of knighthood
from the British Crown.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The good fortune which had followed Sir Thomas
Mitchell throughout his three earlier expeditions did
not forsake him during this one, which proved to be the
last and most arduous of the series. It was his ambition
this time to cross the continent and open an overland
route to the distant Carpentaria. Of all men living,
he was the most likely to accomplish this task. He
did not, indeed, attain the desire of his heart, but in
all other respects his expedition was eminently successful,
and forms a memorable epoch in the history of
exploration. The party mustered at the old rendezvous
of Buree, in the Western District, which, though no
longer the outpost of settlement, was yet a convenient
starting-point. Mitchell chose for his second in command
Mr. Edmund B. Kennedy, the unfortunate explorer
who, several years later, was killed by the blacks
when leading a disastrous expedition in Cape York
Peninsula. The rest of the party were mostly convicts
from Port Jackson, who had volunteered their services
in the hope of obtaining their freedom. The little army,
consisting of two dozen able-bodied men, amply provisioned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 136]</a></span>
left Buree on the 15th of December, 1845.
The old route was followed for a considerable way, and
in a short time the Hervey Range, containing the
sources of the Bogan, was crossed without serious difficulty.
For a long distance westward the country was
now occupied by squatters, but many of the outsiders
had already succumbed to the hostility of the Darling
blacks, who had speared their cattle and otherwise
harassed them beyond the limit of human endurance.
Ten years had now passed away since Mitchell led
his preceding expedition through these parts, and the
abortive attempts at settlement were the principal
changes observable in the general aspect of the country.
One very remarkable minor feature was the appearance
of couch-grass and horehound, which had sprung up
around the stockyards. Mitchell was quite positive
in asserting that no specimen of these plants could
have been found in the district before the white men
settled there.</p>

<p>The party suffered from want of water till Nyngan
was reached, on the 16th January, and then one difficulty
was quickly followed by another. Most of the
men were seized with eye-blight, and compelled to
remain in camp longer than was convenient for the
object of the expedition. But they were again on the
move as soon as circumstances would permit, the
march being now directed towards the Macquarie.
Meanwhile an encampment was made on the
Canonbar, a tributary of the Bogan. While resting
here the saltbush became an object of curiosity, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 137]</a></span>
some interesting experiments were made with this
singular plant of the interior plains. The tiny leaves
were found to be a tolerable substitute for vegetables
after boiling, by which process a yield of pure salt
was obtained in the proportion of one ounce to the
pound. The condition of the stock also bore witness
to the fattening quality of the same plant.</p>

<p>After a few days of eventful travel by way of
Sturt's Duck Ponds, the Macquarie River was struck
a few miles below Mount Harris, which had been an
important landmark for explorers since the time of
Oxley. The channel was dry, but the blacks reported
a heavy flood as near at hand. Mitchell had often
heard of sudden inundations appearing in an arid
part of the country, and was anxious to witness so
singular a visitation. Late in the still evening there
fell upon his ear a dull murmur as of distant thunder,
speedily followed by a cracking and crashing of trees,
and in a few minutes more the river was overflowing
its banks in a wide-spreading flood. The phenomenon
is described as being grand in the extreme, and of so
improbable a character as scarcely to be credited
unless it had been witnessed.</p>

<p>On the 27th the Castlereagh was reached, and the
next day the party found themselves on the banks of
the Darling. For many miles in both directions the
river at this period was studded with pastoral settlements.
Having crossed at Warley, near one of the
stations, Mitchell now struck out for the Narran,
the nearest point of which was reckoned to be about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 138]</a></span>
35 miles distant. The intervening space was found to
consist of choice pastoral country, covered with tall
kangaroo grass. Commissioner Mitchell, son of the
explorer, had previously traversed these parts, and this
expedition soon "pulled up" his tracks. The line of
the Narran River having thus been already explored,
it was traversed as expeditiously as possible, and this
part of the journey was over by the beginning of
April, when the Balonne (pronounced Baloon) was
sighted. Mitchell described it as the finest river he
had seen in Australia, with the exception of the
Murray. The current was very slight, but the water
stretched out in long and beautiful reaches. The
march was once more resumed, and the party moved
along the line of this river till St. George's Bridge
was reached, where the width expanded to 120 yards.
At this point there is a chain of rocks stretching from
bank to bank, which has always the appearance, and
sometimes the convenience, of a natural bridge. It
was this circumstance which led to its being called
St. George's Bridge, a name which it still retains in
common with the flourishing township that has sprung
up in the vicinity.</p>

<p>While enjoying a short interval of repose in this
enchanting situation, Mitchell had the pleasure of
receiving a despatch from headquarters containing a
brief account of Leichhardt's successful journey to
Port Essington. Being somewhat jealous of his rival,
and, it may be, concerned for his own laurels, he
determined on making a redoubled effort to cross the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 139]</a></span>
continent and discover a more practicable route than
Leichhardt had been able to find. Leaving Kennedy
in charge of the dep√¥t at St. George, he took a light
party and pushed forward, having given instructions
to the rest to follow his tracks when the stock should
be sufficiently recruited for travel. One day's march
brought the advance party to the junction of another
important river, which was afterwards found to be the
Maranoa. But they still kept the line of the Balonne
as far as the Cogoon, a considerable tributary, which
was now followed. This led the explorers into a
splendid district, known afterwards as the Fitzroy
Downs, near the centre of which the town of Roma
now stands. This fine region was studded with
isolated mountain-peaks, one of which Mitchell hastened
to ascend. The prospect obtained from its summit
was magnificent, and the pasture so abundant on this
height as to suggest the name of Mount Abundance,
which it has ever since retained. At a short distance
the three-peaked Bindango, standing near its
fellow, Bindeygo, formed most picturesque features in
the landscape. It was on Mount Abundance that the
first bottle-tree was discovered. This is the strangest
product of the Australian forest, and Sir Thomas was
disposed to regard it as a <i>lusus natur√¶</i> in the vegetable
kingdom.</p>

<p>The telescope again brought into view a range of
hills. Mitchell, bent on reaching Carpentaria, had
for some time been disappointed in not finding the
division of the northern waters, and fervently hoped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 140]</a></span>
this distant range would prove to be the dividing
line. This watershed was to him, through the whole
journey, what the horizon is to the traveller&mdash;always
appearing near and ever receding. Many a weary
day did he toil on, sustained by this expectation, but
it kept mocking him to the last, and he went to his
grave without having crossed the coveted watershed.
But for the present he enjoyed the pleasures of hope.
Leaving Mount Abundance he soon discovered the
Amby, which, being followed, led on to the Maranoa,
whose junction with the Balonne he had previously
discovered. Here he established another dep√¥t and
waited for Kennedy, making in the meantime several
short excursions in various directions. Not far from
this dep√¥t a squatting station was subsequently
formed, and more recently an important town has been
built, in both of which the name of Mitchell has been
perpetuated. Kennedy having brought up his party
in excellent condition, the experiment which had been
so successfully made at St. George's Bridge was
repeated here&mdash;the leader again setting out for the
north with a small equipment and a four months'
supply of provisions. The natives in this quarter were
not disposed to stand on friendly terms with the
strangers, and usually kept at a safe distance. One
inconvenience only Mitchell regretted. Many interesting
natural features were observed, especially
mountain-peaks, which he would gladly have made
known under the aboriginal names. Failing in this,
his favourite custom, he called them after some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 141]</a></span>
leading men of the time, as Owen, Faraday, Buckland,
and P. P. King. As an exception, he named one of the
heights Mount Aquarius, in remembrance of a very
seasonable supply of water it had furnished for his
party. This difficulty now seemed to be overcome
for some time by the discovery of the Nive and
the Nivelle, important tributaries of a large river.
This was the Warrego, which would have been
followed had it not persisted in taking a course which
would have led them in the opposite direction to
Carpentaria.</p>

<p>The country to the northward continued to rise till
it reached an elevation of something like 1,500 feet.
Being also of a mountainous character, it was fondly
hoped that here, at least, would be found the long-sought
watershed. This anticipation was rather confirmed
by the discovery of a beautiful stream, now
called Salvator Rosa, which flowed northward with a
clear and musical current. This pleasing delusion
lasted only one day, for on the morrow the lovely
river ended its course in a reedy lake, on the opposite
side of which a channel was found, but it contained
no water at that time. This is one of the heads of the
Nogoa, a river trending too much to the east to suit
Sir Thomas's purpose. Other discoveries of streams or
watercourses were made soon afterwards, two of the
principal being named the Claude and the Balmy
Creek. These designations are suggestive of pleasant
associations, and, while speaking well for the country,
sufficiently prove that the expedition had its share of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 142]</a></span>
enjoyment as well as the usual experience of toil and
fatigue.</p>

<p>The 21st of July was rendered memorable by the
discovery of the Belyando, a fine river, heading
towards the north, and offering a better promise of leading
to the Gulf. In this expectation, it was eagerly
followed, and in four days conducted the explorers
across the Tropic of Capricorn. In many parts the
country was excellent, stretching out in splendid
downs, which squatters have long since applied to a
lucrative purpose, but in other places the axe had
to be used to clear a path through the brigalow
scrubs. In common with other explorers, Mitchell
has noticed that "the Australian rivers have all
distinguishing characteristics, which they seem to
possess from their source to their termination." The
Belyando was no exception. It was found throughout
its course to have an unfortunate propensity for
splitting into channels, which were often difficult to
trace through the thick scrub; but, as a compensation,
these branches afforded excellent facilities for
storage of water against dry seasons. Many days of
persevering travel gave the party a good northing, but,
after passing over three and a half degrees of latitude, it
began to be evident that the Belyando also was going
to deceive them. It had been steadily, and latterly
very decisively, making for the east, thus leaving no
hope of conducting the expedition to Carpentaria.
Mitchell rightly conjectured that it must be the
tributary which Leichhardt had seen joining the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Suttor, and, with a crushing feeling of disappointment,
determined to change his front and return
home.</p>

<p>Having still a sufficient store of provisions, he
was unwilling to continue his homeward track, and
resolved to follow up a river to the westward, which
took its rise in the high ground previously mentioned.
It was found to lead through first-class pasture land,
and this excursion resulted in opening up a large area
of squatting country. Many tributaries were noticed
to fall in on either side, particularly the Alice, which
came from the north. The main river was followed
till it, too, left no hope of leading to the coveted north.
Soon after Sir Thomas gave up the search altogether,
and set his face in earnest for the settled districts,
which he reached, after no long interval, by way of
the Mooni River and the Liverpool Plains. Having
failed to enter into communication with the aborigines,
he was unable to ascertain the native name of the
river which had led him so far to the west. It was
the last of his great discoveries, and he called it after
the name of the Queen, an unfortunate designation, as
there is another Victoria River on the west coast.
About the same period Captain Sturt was exploring
on another part of this river, and gave it the name of
Cooper's Creek. The natives called it the Barcoo, and
by this name it is now generally known throughout
its whole course.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3>KENNEDY'S DISASTROUS EXPEDITION TO CAPE YORK.</h3>


<p>This chapter is from first to last a tale of woe. The
history of exploration, tragic as it has so often been,
contains no parallel to the expedition which is now to
be described. Of the thirteen brave men who, full of
hope, set forth on this memorable journey, only three
starved and emaciated shadows of humanity returned
to tell the story of their miserable sufferings. The
disaster produced in Sydney an impression which
was the more saddening as a successful issue had been
confidently expected. The leader, Mr. Edmund B.
Kennedy, was supposed to be a thoroughly capable
person. He had formerly been taken from the Survey
Department and placed second in command of the
northern expedition of Sir Thomas Mitchell, whose
discoveries on the Barcoo and the Warrego he had
subsequently followed up on his own account. So
great care had been taken in selecting the most promising
leader, for this reason, simply, that the colony
was now passionately in earnest on this business. The
rising importance and threatening attitude of Port
Phillip made it more than ever necessary to discover,
if possible, a practicable route to some northern port
which might serve as an <i>entrep√¥t</i> for the trade with
India. Mitchell, after doing his best, had failed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 145]</a></span>
supply this want. Leichhardt had, indeed, been more
successful, for he had actually reached Port Essington;
but his track was too rough and circuitous to serve the
purpose of commerce. Another effort to reach the
same object was now to be made on a modified plan.
To simplify the process, it was proposed to land a
party of explorers at Rockingham Bay, with instructions
to proceed overland to Port Albany, near Cape
York, in the extreme north. This was the primary
object, and if it could be attained, other advantages
might follow in the opening up of new country, and
the eventual connection of the survey with those of
Leichhardt and Mitchell.</p>

<p>The enterprise commenced with unfavourable omens.
The voyage to Rockingham Bay was tempestuous,
and extended over the unusual period of twenty-one
days. By the 1st day of June, 1848, the adventurers
had escaped from the perils of the sea, and committed
themselves to the guardianship of a land inhabited as
yet only by savages. A hazardous journey of six
months lay between them and Port Albany, while their
only resource against starvation consisted of 1 ton of
flour, 90 lbs. of tea, and 600 lbs. of sugar, together
with a few sheep, which were soon almost wholly lost.
It was arranged that a relief vessel should be waiting
at Cape York to receive the explorers at the end of
their journey, and it was promised also that an
attempt would be made to communicate with them at
Princess Charlotte Bay, if they could engage to
reach that place by the month of August. With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 146]</a></span>
these arrangements and understandings the <i>Tam
o' Shanter</i> spread sail, and left Kennedy with
his heroic dozen to battle with difficulties, known
and unknown, as they best could. These unhappily
commenced at once, and never ceased till
nearly all this brave band found rest in the arms
of death. The ground on which the landing had
been effected was covered with interminable swamps,
and five precious weeks were spent in turning these,
before any northing could be made. It was the misfortune
of this ill-provisioned party to encounter
within a short compass nearly all the obstacles
which have beset Australian explorers, and
these, truly, have been neither few nor small.
Scarcely had the maze of marshes been left behind
when impenetrable thickets threatened to bar further
progress. These first visitors to York Peninsula found
the scrubs entangled and interlaced by a new creeper
which is now known under the name of <i>Calamus
Australis</i>, and this novelty proved to be a scourge of
the first magnitude. For days in succession the axe
had to be used to cut a passage through this exquisite
specimen of nature's lattice-work, and then the severed
tendrils, furnished as they were with curved spines,
and made the plaything of the wind, kept hooking the
flesh of the men at work, who were thus subjected to
perpetual annoyance. But a more serious enemy now
began to hang upon the rear. The blacks, having
assumed a threatening attitude for some time past, at
last appeared in strong force, painted and armed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the fight. Outward signs of friendship were still kept
up; but it was too evident that they were bent on
mischief, and only waited a fit opportunity for a
decisive assault. When least expected a spear was
thrown into the camp, which Kennedy determined to
accept as a challenge, and gave battle. This decision
was exceedingly unfortunate, as it led to extremities
at once. Men like Sturt would have tried every conceivable
shift before allowing matters to come to the
<i>dernier ressort</i>, and might have gained their object by
the mere sound of a gun. But Kennedy ordered his
men to load and fire upon the savages at once. Four or
five of the ringleaders fell, and the rest retreated for
the present; but only to nurse their wrath and meditate
revenge. Here was the beginning of another
train of sorrows, for the barbarians never ceased to
dog Kennedy's steps till their enmity was quenched
in his blood.</p>

<p>The progress of the expedition was slow and unsatisfactory.
Cases of individual sickness occasioned
irritating delays, and physical hindrances became more
frequent than ever. A considerable part of the route
lay between the spurs of the range which would have
to be crossed before Cape York was reached. It was
with great difficulty that the drays carrying the provisions
had been brought over the rugged country, and
it had sometimes been necessary to lower them into
the ravines by means of ropes. As the journey ahead
looked still more precipitous, it was judged impracticable
to take them much further, and with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 148]</a></span>
reluctance Kennedy resolved on exchanging this mode
of conveyance for pack-horses. Everything that could
be spared was accordingly abandoned, for the animals
were now too poor to carry heavy loads. In this manner
and under such difficulties a fresh start was made.
Amid so many discouragements only one gleam of
hope sustained the heroic adventurers. They were
now nearing Princess Charlotte Bay, the appointed
rendezvous for themselves and the succour which was
promised from the sea. But they had been delayed
too long to admit of this assistance being confidently
relied on. August was fixed as the time of meeting,
but October had now come, and they began to be
uneasy lest the vessel should have given them up and
returned. These fears, as the issue proved, were only
too well founded. The hapless wanderers, standing
on the precipices of the range, scanned the inhospitable
coast for miles around this lonely trysting-place;
but instead of the wished-for help, now a question
of life and death, they were met by nothing but
blank despair. With heavy hearts the explorers again
set their faces towards Cape York, now knowing for
certain that they must either reach this goal or lay
their bones in the wilderness. Unhappily, the difficulties
of travel thickened more and more, and it
became painfully evident to Kennedy that he would
have to leave the greater part of his men and strike
out with all speed, in the hope of returning with
assistance. Provisions, too, had become alarmingly
short, and under any circumstances starvation seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 149]</a></span>
all but inevitable. The camp was now on Pudding-pan
Hill, in the vicinity of Weymouth Bay, and it
was determined to leave eight men in this dep√¥t for
the present. All the provisions that could be spared
were 28 lbs. of flour and a couple of horses, which
were only walking skeletons. Kennedy reckoned on
reaching Port Albany in about a fortnight, and started
with a light party of four men, including an aboriginal
of tried fidelity named Jacky Jacky. The remainder
of this history is derived from the barely intelligible
language of poor Jacky. It appears that for the first
three weeks very unsatisfactory progress was made,
much precious time being lost in consequence of a gun
accident. One of the men being thus rendered unfit
for travel, and another required to nurse him,
Kennedy resolved to divide his party a second time.
He accordingly left three men near Shelborne Bay,
and, with only Jacky to accompany him, determined
to make a life-and-death struggle to bring succour
from Port Albany. But his own strength was rapidly
failing, and the hostility of the blacks, who had so
long hung upon his rear, was daily assuming a more
deadly aspect. This misfortune was the more to be
regretted as this tedious and toilsome journey was
almost at an end. From one of the heights Kennedy
caught a glimpse of Port Albany, with its neighbouring
island, and pointed them out to his dusky
companion. But his life's journey was still nearer its
close. The blacks were gathering in hundreds. An
ineffectual attempt was tried to elude their vigilance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 150]</a></span>
by camping in the scrub without a fire, but they again
made their presence known by hurling the deadly
spear. Jacky made a rush to rally the horses, which,
frantic with their wounds, had begun to dash through
the scrub, and, on returning, found his master had
been speared, surrounded, and robbed. A feeble
resistance was offered to the assault of the savages,
but it had little effect, and was soon over. Jacky
thought Kennedy was dying fast, and asked if he
was now going to leave him. He said he was fatally
wounded, and, having given a brief order concerning
his papers, breathed his last in the arms of his faithful
attendant. Such was the end of Mr. E. B. Kennedy,
a man who has left his mark on our history, and will
be honoured by posterity as one of the most heroic,
if not the most judicious, and certainly the least
fortunate, of the Australian explorers.</p>

<p>Jacky, being now alone, and more dead than alive,
made his way as best he could to Port Albany. His
progress was sometimes less than a mile per day, but
he struggled on in the hope of finding the promised
vessel. Almost six months had passed away since the
party of thirteen disembarked at Rockingham Bay.
It was within two days of Christmas, and those in
charge of the ship were debating with themselves
whether it was worth while waiting any longer, when
a poor emaciated creature was observed to drag himself
from the forest and make signs to the vessel.
Being conveyed on board, his tale of woe was soon
told, in such words as he could use. The gravity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the situation became apparent immediately, and the
order was given at once to hoist sail for Shelborne
Bay, in the hope of being able to rescue the three men
who had been left at Pudding-pan Hill. The search
was unsuccessful. No trace of these unfortunates
could then, or has ever since been discovered. There
still remained the dep√¥t at Weymouth Bay, where the
necessities of the eight men left there could not be
otherwise than urgent in the extreme, if they were
still alive. All haste was made to the rescue. The
eight were all found, but six of them were dead. The
two survivors were more like ghosts than human
beings of flesh and blood. The tale of miseries which
they had to relate was heartrending. In addition to
the lingering horrors of starvation, they had to endure
incessant attacks from the blacks, who, knowing they
had them in their power, enjoyed a savage delight in
prolonging the distress of their victims. Yet it appears
that the half-dozen eventually died of hunger, a fate
which the survivors must inevitably have shared if
relief had been much longer delayed. Having been
too weak to bury their dead companions, this sacred
duty was performed by the ship's crew, who thereafter
hastened homeward with the miserable remains of
Kennedy's heroic but ill-starred expedition.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3>LEICHHARDT'S EXPEDITIONS TO PORT ESSINGTON AND
INTO THE INTERIOR.</h3>


<p>Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt, who was born in Germany
and educated in France, came to Australia in the year
1840. He commenced his career in Sydney as a
lecturer on botany, his favourite science, and became
immediately popular. Naturally fond of travel, and
being eager for enterprise, Leichhardt took to the
bush, where he earned his fame and lost his life.
His first essays in exploration were made in the
country lying between Brisbane and Wide Bay,
which he traversed specially in the interests of
botanical and geological science. In these adventures
he was associated for the most part with the blacks,
who welcomed him as a benefactor on account of his
medical skill, of which he gave them the full benefit
without fee or reward.</p>

<p>Having accomplished his object in this part of the
country, Leichhardt returned to Sydney, where he
found public opinion strongly excited on the question
of exploration. Sir Thomas Mitchell, having led three
expeditions into the interior with great success, was
mainly instrumental in creating this outburst of
enthusiasm, which called for other enterprises of a
like nature and purpose. At this period, also, a keen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 153]</a></span>
desire was manifested for an overland route to
Carpentaria as a highway, so far, to India, which was
supposed to offer an unlimited market for Australian
horses. Already a settlement had come into existence
at Port Essington, which was reckoned a suitable
<i>entrep√¥t</i> for the prospective traffic. The one thing
wanted was an overland route to this place, and it
was generally thought the time had come when an
attempt should be made to discover it. Sir Thomas
Mitchell was again to the front, expressing himself
ready for the undertaking, with Dr. Leichhardt as
second in command. He had already arranged to
proceed to his old dep√¥t at Fort Bourke and to strike
north for Carpentaria. But a fatal obstacle was
unexpectedly interposed. Sir George Gipps, being in
a bad humour with his advisers, refused to confirm
the vote for supplies which the Council had unanimously
passed, and, as a natural consequence, the
whole project fell to the ground. This was a sore
blow to Leichhardt, but it did not unman him.
Despairing of help or countenance from the Governor,
he volunteered to lead an expedition to Port Essington
on his own account if private liberality should prove
itself equal to the occasion. In a very short time
sufficient resources were forthcoming, and Leichhardt
now set himself to redeem his promise.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>In this expedition it was resolved to start from
Moreton Bay and keep the eastern fall of the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 154]</a></span>
range, thus avoiding the parched-up interior and
following a route which was likely to furnish an
adequate supply of water. Leichhardt could never
have been far beyond the reach of the sea-breeze&mdash;a
circumstance which caused Mitchell to speak of him,
rather contemptuously, as a "timid coaster." The
party, consisting of ten persons, with seven months'
provisions, made an auspicious start from Brisbane,
and had reached the outskirts of settlement by the
1st of October, 1844. Crossing the Darling Downs,
the River Condamine was followed as far as practicable,
after which a dividing range was traversed and
the Dawson River discovered. It flowed through a
magnificent valley, which was soon after proved to be
an excellent pastoral district. When it turned too
much to the east a more northerly course was steered,
which led to the discovery of Palm-Tree Creek, in a
splendid valley abounding in palms, and hence the
name. The next stage was much impeded by
brigalow scrub, but a succession of lagoons supplied
the party with plenty of water and excellent game.
Zamia Creek followed in the line of discovery,
bounded by the Expedition Range, which was crossed,
and Comet Creek discovered soon after. This latter
led on to the Mackenzie, which had to be abandoned
in a short time, as it flowed too much to the east.
The picturesque Peak Range was now passed. The
mountains not only appeared magnificent in point of
scenery, but were believed also to contain precious
stones. Leichhardt says:&mdash;"A profusion of chalcedony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and fine specimens of agate were observed in many
places along the basaltic ridges." On the 13th of
February they discovered an important river, which
was named the Isaacs, but it was not followed, as the
course was again directed towards the mountains.
Shortly after they had the good fortune to come upon
the Suttor, which brought them to the Burdekin.
This was the best discovery yet made, as it served
them for a guide over more than two degrees of
latitude. When this river also left them for the coast,
their route was directed more inland, with a view of
reaching Carpentaria. In this cross-country journey
a conspicuous mountain observed in the distance
received the name of Mount Lang, "after Dr. Lang, the
distinguished historiographer of New South Wales."
A few unimportant creeks having been crossed, they
found themselves on the western fall, and discovered
one of the Gulf rivers, which was named the Lynd.
Here, and at several later camps, the explorers were
treated with a visit from some awfully pertinacious
intruders. "We had scarcely left our camp," says
Leichhardt, "when swarms of crows and kites took
possession of it, after having given us a fair fight
during the previous days whilst we were drying the
meat. Their boldness was, indeed, remarkable; and if
the natives had as much we should soon have to quit
our camps." In this district a botanical novelty, in
the form of a bread-fruit tree, was found, and used to
some advantage. As the Lynd did not lead in the
most suitable direction, it was left, and a straight line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 156]</a></span>
taken to the Gulf. This was the occasion of the
discovery of another river, which was called the
Mitchell, in honour of the distinguished explorer; but
it, too, was given up for a shorter course. In this
quarter a deplorable accident occurred. The camp
was attacked during night by the blacks, when
Gilbert, the naturalist to the expedition, was killed.
From this point the journey was continued round the
head of the Gulf. Numerous rivers were crossed,
some of which had been long before discovered by
exploring navigators, and others were now for the
first time brought to light. Among the latter were
the Gilbert and the Roper, both receiving names in
honour of members of the expedition. The Roper
River had many tributaries, one of which was called
Flying-Fox Creek, from the myriads of these
creatures which had chosen it for their haunt.
Leichhardt says:&mdash;"I went with Charley and Brown
to the spot where we had seen the greatest number of
flying-foxes, and whilst I was examining the neighbouring
tree, my companions shot 67, of which 55
were brought to our camp, which served for dinner,
supper, and luncheon." By the 24th of November the
expedition had crossed the watershed between the
streams flowing into the Gulf and those heading for
the Indian Ocean. After much toilsome travel, the
South Alligator River was reached, about 60 miles
from its mouth and 140 from Port Essington. In this
locality the waterfowl are described as being seen, not
in crowds, but in "clouds." "Here," says Leichhardt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 157]</a></span>
"we should have been tolerably comfortable but for a
large green-eyed fly, which was extremely troublesome
to us, and which scarcely allowed our poor
horses to feed." In order to avoid some bad, rocky
ground, the party turned to the south and struck the
East Alligator River. The last stage of the journey
was travelled under the direction of a native guide,
and the goal of the expedition reached in safety.
After a month's rest in this settlement, Leichhardt
found a schooner bound for Port Jackson, and embraced
this opportunity of returning to Sydney by
sea. His unexpected appearance there seemed like an
apparition from the other world. For a long time he
had been given up for lost, and a search expedition
had already come back unsuccessful. The citizens of
Sydney at once instituted a public subscription for
Leichhardt and his associates, who had thus travelled
over 3,000 miles in fifteen months. The amount
reached the figure of ¬£1,500, which was supplemented
by a Government grant of ¬£1,000. The Royal Geographical
Societies, also, hastened to show their appreciation
of the explorer's labours by presenting him
with their gold medals. These rewards had been as
honestly earned as they were handsomely made. The
route he had laid open was, indeed, useless for the
purpose intended, as being impracticable for traffic, and
inferior to others which have since been discovered,
but the expedition brought to the knowledge of the
colonists an immense extent of excellent country,
which was speedily occupied by pastoral tenants.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 158]</a></span>
</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>A short period of repose sufficed to recruit the
wearied explorer and brace him up for future effort.
Now more enthusiastic than ever, Leichhardt conceived
the heroic idea of traversing the entire continent
at its greatest width, starting from Moreton
Bay and proceeding through the deserts to Swan River
in Western Australia. He was now in possession of
some private means, and his zeal was again supported
by numerous friends. This new expedition consisted
of nine persons, and his equipment, especially under
the head of live stock, was provided on the largest
scale the colony had yet witnessed. These consisted
of 108 sheep, 270 goats, 40 bullocks, 15 horses, and
15 mules. His plan was to follow his former route
for a few hundred miles, and then bear off to the
westward. All went tolerably well till the Dawson
country was passed, after which wet weather became
a serious hindrance. At Comet Creek the party
began to suffer from fever and ague, but still pushed
on to the Mackenzie, where they found themselves in
a deplorable plight. The resources had been wasted,
not so much as a dose of medicine being left for the
sick. No one being able to attend to the sheep and
cattle, the whole were irretrievably lost. It now
became evident to Leichhardt, as it had been for some
time to his companions, that it would be the part of
madness to attempt the unknown desert so ill-furnished
with supplies. Conquered by dire necessity, Leichhardt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 159]</a></span>
returned home with a heavy heart, after a
fruitless journey of seven months. The expedition
had proved a total failure, and, as the old track had
been followed, the journey added nothing to what was
already known of the distant parts of the country.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>In the meantime Sir Thomas Mitchell had made a
fourth exploring expedition, and on this occasion had
done his best to discover an interior route to Carpentaria.
He failed, however, in this object; but in all
other respects the undertaking had been eminently
successful. In one quarter the tracks of the two
explorers had approached within a short distance of
one another, and Leichhardt, being in possession of a
considerable salvage from the wreck of his second
expedition, proposed to examine the intervening district&mdash;a
fine territory, now known as the Fitzroy
Downs. This was a small undertaking for so great
an explorer. Nor was it a very necessary one either,
for the squatters were already in possession of the
country, and the crack of the stockman's whip suggested
to Leichhardt the propriety of returning home
and preparing for an enterprise more worthy of his
well-won reputation.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Arrangements were again made in earnest for crossing
the continent to Swan River, all being ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 160]</a></span>
set out from Moreton Bay with a party of only six
men, provisioned for a journey which was calculated
to extend over two or three years. The second in command
was one Classan, brother-in-law to Leichhardt,
who had just arrived from Germany to join the
expedition. The late Rev. W. B. Clarke, being surprised
at so peculiar an arrangement, asked the "new
chum" what qualifications he possessed for the most
perilous enterprise hitherto attempted in Australia?
Classan replied that he was a seaman who had suffered
shipwreck, and was, therefore, well fitted to endure
hardship! In this expedition Leichhardt resolved to
abandon his old route for that of Sir Thomas Mitchell,
which he proposed to follow as far as the bend of the
Victoria (Barcoo), and then turn westward. He seems
to have fallen into this track near Mount Abundance,
in the neighbourhood of the present town of Roma, in
Queensland. It is not possible to trace the expedition
much further, nor is there any hope of the veil of
mystery ever being lifted. Here are Leichhardt's last
words to the civilized world, as written from
M'Pherson's station, on the Cogoon, under date of
3rd April, 1848:&mdash;"I take the last opportunity of
giving you an account of my progress. In eleven
days we travelled from Mr. Burrell's station, on the
Condamine, to Mr. M'Pherson's, on the Fitzroy Downs.
Though the country was occasionally very difficult,
yet everything went on very well. My mules are in
excellent order, my companions in excellent spirits.
Three of my cattle are footsore, but I shall kill one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 161]</a></span>
them to-night, to lay in our necessary stock of dried
beef. The Fitzroy Downs, on which we travelled for
about 22 miles from east to west, is, indeed, a splendid
region, and Sir Thomas Mitchell has not exaggerated
their beauty in his account. The soil is pebbly and
sound, richly grassed, and, to judge from the myalls,
of the most fattening quality. I came right on to
Mount Abundance and passed over a gap in it with
my whole train. My latitude agreed well with
Mitchell's. I fear that the absence of water in the
Fitzroy Downs will render this fine country, to a
great degree, unavailable. I observe the thermometer
daily at 6 a.m. and 8 p.m., which are the only convenient
hours. I have tried the wet thermometer,
but am afraid my observations will be very deficient.
I shall, however, improve on them as I proceed. The
only serious accident that has happened was the loss
of a spade, but we were fortunate enough to make it
up at this station. Though the days are still very
hot, the beautiful clear nights are cool and benumb
the mosquitoes, which have ceased to trouble
us. Myriads of flies are the only annoyance we
have. Seeing how much I have been favoured
on my present progress, I am full of hopes that
our Almighty Protector will allow me to bring my
darling scheme to a successful termination." This
last communication, unfortunately, says nothing
about the direction in which he intended to travel,
and his route henceforth is a matter of pure conjecture.
After years of weary waiting Mr. Hovenden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Hely was sent to search for his tracks, but without
avail. Hely was played upon by the blacks, who
pretended to show him several of Leichhardt's camping
grounds, and finally the bones of the murdered
party. They turned out, however, to be mutton-bones,
and the search ended in nothing. Mr. A. C. Gregory,
himself a distinguished explorer, led two expeditions
with the same object in view, and discovered a tree
marked "L," which may or may not have been made
by Leichhardt. Walker, when searching for Burke
and Wills, believed he had found some traces of the
missing expedition; but these marks were again
successfully contested by Landsborough. Still later a
Mr. Skuthorpe, in a most mercenary fashion, tried to
persuade the public, and especially the Government of
New South Wales, that he had discovered certain relics
of the expedition, including Leichhardt's journal in
good preservation; but the affair was looked upon as
an imposition, and nothing further has transpired. It
cannot be said with certainty that a single trace of
Leichhardt has been discovered since he wrote his
letter from the Fitzroy Downs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3>MR. A. C. GREGORY'S EXPEDITION TO THE NORTH-WEST
INTERIOR.</h3>


<p>The part of the continent which shall next engage
our attention is the north-west interior. Up to this
period of our history very little had been known of
this quarter, except along the seaboard and, in sparse
places, for a few miles inland. The Victoria had been
discovered in 1840 by Captain Stokes, who described
it as a rival to the Murray, and, moreover, sailed up
its channel for 50 miles without reaching the head of
the navigation. By this waterway it was thought
possible to reach the north-western interior, in which
some traces of Leichhardt might be met with. The
conduct of this expedition was entrusted to Mr. A. C.
Gregory, a very capable explorer, and a man of
scientific attainments. His party numbered eighteen
persons, including his brother, Mr. H. Gregory, Mr.
Wilson, geologist, and the now famous Baron Von
Mueller as botanist. The party took with them 50
horses and 200 sheep. The <i>Tom Tough</i> and the
<i>Monarch</i> landed the expedition on the Plains of
Promise, near the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
on the 24th September, 1855. The <i>Monarch</i> then
returned to Moreton Bay, while the <i>Tom Tough</i> sailed
round to the Victoria, having received orders to wait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 164]</a></span>
for the rest of the party, who were to proceed overland.
In six days they made the Macadam Range, and in
eight more came on to the Fitzmaurice River. At
this camp the horses, which had already been greatly
reduced in number, were bitten by alligators, and
three of them died. On reaching the Victoria the
<i>Tom Tough</i> was not to be seen, as she had been
driven ashore elsewhere and had sustained severe
injury. On the 3rd of January, 1856, Mr. Gregory
started with eight men and followed up the Victoria
for 100 miles. In latitude 16¬∞ 26' S. it split into
two branches, each of which was in succession traced
up to the vanishing point. The explorers then struck
forth into the desert, proceeding on a southerly course.
A journey of 300 miles brought them, on the 22nd of
February, to a promising creek, to which they gave
the name of Sturt, in memory of the eminent explorer.
To their intense disappointment, this clue
also failed them, for Sturt's Creek finally resolved
itself into a sheet of salt water, to which they gave
the appropriate designation of Lake Termination.
Two mountains in this neighbourhood were called
Mount Mueller and Mount Wilson, after the botanist
and the geologist of the expedition. Once more the
terrible salt desert lay before the baffled explorers.
"Nothing," says the leader, "could have been more
forbidding than the long, straight lines of drift-sand
which, having nearly an east and west direction, rose
beyond each other like the waves of the sea; and
though the red glare of the sand was partially concealed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 165]</a></span>
by a scanty growth of spinifex, the reflection
from its surface caused the passing clouds to be
coloured a deep purple. We had long passed the
limit to which the tropical rains of the north-west
coast extend, and the country south of 19¬∞ seemed
only to be visited by occasional thunderstorms. Thus
for a few miles the grass would be fresh and green,
then there would be a long interval of dry, parched
country, where no rain appeared to have fallen for
a twelve-month. The channel of the creek also
decreased in size, and the frequent occurrence of
salicornia indicated the saline nature of the soil; the
water became brackish, then salt, and finally spread
out and terminated in the dry bed of a salt lake, a mile
in diameter, which communicated with a second, of
larger size, nine miles long and five wide. Though now
quite dry, there were marks of water having stood for
considerable periods, of from 10 to 15 feet deep, as
the shells of mussels in their natural position were
abundant more than a mile from the ordinary bank of
the lake, showing that a large tract of country is
sometimes inundated. As the mussels are a species
which live in fresh water, it is evident that at such
times the lake is not salt, but it would appear that as
the waters evaporate and recede they become saline,
as the shells found within the limits of the lake were
of other species which affect brackish or salt water."
One more attempt to make for the south proved
abortive, and, with many regrets, Gregory returned
to the dep√¥t, after having penetrated within 730
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 166]</a></span>
miles of Sturt's most advanced camp towards the
centre of Australia.</p>

<p>Falling back upon alternative instructions, the
leader now left the Victoria, and, making his way
across Arnheim's Land, reached the River Roper.
The track of Leichhardt round the southern shores of
the Gulf was followed for the most part. The Plains
of Promise were crossed, but Gregory scarcely agreed
with Stokes in his unqualified praise of this country.
From the Albert River he resolved to seek for a
better track to Moreton Bay than Leichhardt's. The
Flinders was reached on the 8th of September,
between which river and the Gilbert some good
country was discovered. The latter was traced for
180 miles of its course. The Burdekin was reached
by the 16th of October, and a fortnight later its
junction with the Suttor. Gregory traced the
Belyando to 22¬∞, thus connecting the routes of
Mitchell and Leichhardt with his own. Passing the
Mackenzie and the Comet, the Dawson River was
reached by the 15th of November. The course was
then made to Brisbane through the Burnett district, a
journey of 400 miles. The parties in this expedition
had been absent sixteen months from the haunts of
civilization. They had travelled 2,000 miles by sea
and 5,000 by land.</p>

<h3>BURKE AND WILLS'S EXPEDITION ACROSS THE
AUSTRALIAN CONTINENT.</h3>


<p>The golden age of Australian exploration dates from
1860. The preceding half-century is rich in heroic
efforts put forth in this direction, and bears witness to
many a conquest over the mysterious interior as the
fruit of much self-sacrifice. Yet these results, as a
class, were of a secondary character, only sometimes
answering the hopes of the explorers themselves, and
not doing so at all when these expectations rose to
the ambition of crossing the continent. But those
days of comparative failure are now over, and 1860
marks the commencement of a bright and glorious era
for the explorers of this hitherto dark continent.
Within the space of the next two years Australia
was crossed no fewer than six times, by as many
expeditions. The foremost place in time, as well as
interest, belongs to Burke and Wills, and for this
reason the story of their victory and sufferings will
form the subject of the present chapter.</p>

<p>Victoria has the credit of this expedition. The
movement originated in the offer of ¬£1,000 by Mr.
Ambrose Kyte, on condition of this sum being doubled
by voluntary subscriptions. The terms were soon
complied with, after which the Government generously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 168]</a></span>
came to its aid by a vote of ¬£5,500. The arrangements
were undertaken by a committee of the Royal
Society, and, as the funds were ample, it was determined
to equip the expedition on the most liberal
scale. As a new feature in exploration, two dozen
camels were imported from India, and every provision
was made to secure the object on which the young
colony had set its heart. The only difficulty that
remained was to find a competent leader. After
much delay had been occasioned through unsuccessful
negotiation, the command was finally given to an
enthusiastic volunteer named Robert O'Hara Burke.
This remarkable man was a native of Ireland, but was
educated in Belgium, and had served as an officer in
the Austrian cavalry. He subsequently returned to
the "Green Isle," and entered the constabulary force.
Having emigrated to Australia he received a similar
appointment, and held the position of inspector of
police when this new honour was conferred upon him.
He was a brave and generous man&mdash;few, indeed, have
been more heroic and faithful&mdash;but, as he possessed
little acquaintance with Australian exploration, and
was destitute of special qualifications for the work,
his appointment has generally been regarded as a
mistake on the part of the committee. The position
of second in command, with the office of astronomical
observer, was conferred on William John Wills, who
had been born in Devonshire as late as 1834. He
came out to Australia while a mere youth, and for a
time had to betake himself to the humble occupation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of shepherd, but being well educated and possessing
excellent gifts of head and heart, he soon rose to the
position of a government surveyor, and afterwards
obtained the honourable office of assistant astronomer
in the Melbourne Observatory.</p>

<p>The expedition, when fully organized, consisted of
15 men and 24 camels, with twelve months' provisions,
weighing in all 21 tons. The start was made
from Melbourne on the 20th of August, 1860&mdash;an
imposing spectacle, which has yet left its impression
on the memories of many of the older inhabitants of
that city. By the committee's direction, they were
to march first to the Darling, next to the Lower
Barcoo (Cooper's Creek), and then strike northward
for the Gulf of Carpentaria. Melbourne
had been left too late in the season, and this
disadvantage was aggravated by delays occasioned
by the unwieldiness of the expedition and insubordination
on the part of some of the men. At length
Menindie, on the Darling, was reached. The name is
new in the history of exploration, but the locality
is in the neighbourhood of Laidley Ponds, a quarter
which was then well known to the readers of Sturt
and Mitchell. Burke formed a dep√¥t here, in which
he left the greater part of his men and some beasts of
burden to recruit from the fatigues of their toilsome
journey. Taking Wills, together with six men and
15 camels, he made his arrangements for a quick
journey across to the Barcoo. It had been his intention
to follow Sturt's old track, but he was dissuaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 170]</a></span>
from his purpose by a Mr. Wright, superintendent of
a neighbouring pastoral station, who told him of a
better route further to the north, and volunteered to
conduct the party over it in person. Both the advice
and the offer were accepted; nor did experience fail
to justify the change of plan. Travelling was agreeable
on this new route, and water found at intervals
of not more than 20 miles. The march from Menindie
to Torowotto was little short of a pleasure excursion,
and Burke, with the generosity which was part of his
nature, now associated Wright permanently with the
expedition, giving him the position of third in command.
Being no longer needed as a guide, he was
sent back from this place to the dep√¥t on the Darling,
with orders to bring forward the heavy supplies with
all convenient speed. The advance party continued
their progress into the interior, and, on the 11th of
November, struck the Barcoo, which was followed
until a suitable place was found where they might
encamp till the arrival of Wright with the remainder
of the expedition. The delay proved to
be longer than had been expected; and, that the
time might not be altogether lost, some explorations
were made in the surrounding country, and several
promising routes to the Gulf were examined with
little satisfactory result. Worst of all, some of the
camels were lost, and although much time was consumed
in the search, they were never seen again by
the explorers. Wright's delay was becoming as vexatious
as it seemed to be inexcusable. Six weeks had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 171]</a></span>
passed away since he left Burke, and yet the whole
distance from Menindie to the encampment on the
Barcoo had been traversed by the advance party in
twenty-two days. Chafed and irritated almost to
madness under the disappointment, Burke determined
to endure it no longer, and resolved "to dash into the
interior, and cross the continent at all hazards." For
this purpose he again divided his party, taking with
himself Wills and two others, named King and Gray,
together with six camels, one horse, and twelve weeks'
provisions. The camp was now transformed into a
permanent dep√¥t, in which were left four men, six
camels, and four horses. One of the party named
Brahe was put in command, with instructions to erect
a stockade as a means of defence against the natives,
and to detain Wright after his arrival with supplies.
Burke was now entering upon the real difficulties of
his gigantic undertaking, and had at command only a
mere fraction of the means which he had brought out
of Melbourne. But of hope and courage he had lost
nothing. On the 16th of December he took leave of
Brahe and his men, telling them, with his wonted
generosity, that if he were not back in three months,
they might consult for their own welfare as should
appear to be necessary.</p>

<p>Burke and Wills, together with their brave companions
King and Gray, now plunged into the
unknown deserts and shaped their course for Carpentaria.
During the earlier stage the whole party
rode on the camels or the one horse that accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 172]</a></span>
them, but the animals got weary, and it became
necessary to trudge it on foot. Burke and Wills
walked ahead, carrying a rifle and a revolver, while
King and Gray followed with the beasts of burden.
Their progress was necessarily slow, even though they
had not encountered serious obstacles of a physical
kind. Comfort, or anything approaching to it, was
utterly unknown. Night after night the toil-worn
wanderers encamped <i>sub Jove frigido</i>, without tents
or covering of any sort. Yet these hardships were
endured without murmur or regret. Burke is reported
to have said he would not care though he had
only a shirt on his back, if so be that he could cross
Australia. It is impossible to give ample details of
this northward journey, for the materials are scanty.
Burke was not much of a literary character, and
found it too irksome a task to keep a diary. Wills
was vastly superior in this respect, but yet his
journal, otherwise so satisfactory, is defective here.
This much is certain, that they pursued a north-westerly
course through the interior, by way of what
was afterwards known as M'Kinlay Range, discovering
and naming Gray and Wills creeks, Mount
Standish, and other topographical positions which
have since become prominent landmarks. By the
27th of January they had crossed the northern watershed
and come on to the Cloncurry, which led them
to the Flinders. This river was mistaken for the
Albert, but was scrupulously followed, in the hope
that it would lead to the Gulf. After six weeks'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 173]</a></span>
absence from the Barcoo signs of the neighbourhood
of the ocean began to appear. The waters of the
Flinders became brackish, and gradually widened
into an estuary. A sight of the ocean would have
gladdened the eyes of the explorers beyond measure,
but a forest of mangroves deprived them of this
gratification. Nevertheless, they had reached the
mouth of the Flinders, and were within the limits of
the rise and fall of the tide. The object which had
cost so many sacrifices was accomplished at last,
<i>and the continent of Australia traversed from end
to end</i>.</p>

<p>The condition of the explorers was now pitiable in
the extreme, and never were men more in need of
rest or had better deserved it; but to rest here meant
to perish, for only a fag-end of the rations was left,
and if they were to see the Barcoo dep√¥t again, it
must be by subsisting on the merest pittance for the
next two months. For this reason no time was lost
at the Gulf, and the return journey was commenced
on the 21st February. The weather happened to set
in wet, which was a real misfortune, as it added
immensely to the inconvenience of travel, seeing their
strength was almost spent. The camels broke down
and had all to be abandoned except two, which were
also in a weakly state. The one horse which had
been brought from the dep√¥t was killed and eaten, to
save the provisions. In addition to all the other evils
sickness began to affect them, and Gray was so ill
that he had to be strapped on the back of a camel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 174]</a></span>
The poor fellow, driven by starvation, had lately been
caught appropriating more than his share of the provisions,
and was chastised by Burke for the offence&mdash;an
act of discipline which might have been spared,
for poor Gray was not to eat much more of the little
store. Day after day he was carried forward on the
journey, but each night found him getting weaker,
and it was necessary to make a halt to let him die.
He breathed his last in a lonely wilderness, sacrificing
his life without a murmur to the cause which he
loved not less than his master did. His three surviving
companions mournfully buried him in the
desert with such strength as was still left them, but
were so exhausted with the labour of digging his
grave as to require a day's rest before attempting to
renew the journey. They, too, must have succumbed
to their troubles but for the sustaining
power of hope, which told them the longed-for dep√¥t
could not now be far distant. Other indications
also pointed the same way, and in four days after
leaving Gray's grave their eyes were gladdened with
the sight of the familiar landmarks of the old
camping ground on the Barcoo. Burke gathered up
all his remaining strength and made the desert ring
with "cooeys" for his former comrades, and listened
for a reply; but, <i>horresco referens</i>, no response was
returned but the echo of his own voice. Could it be
possible that the depot was abandoned, and the
miserable men left to perish in the wilderness? The
appalling thought was quickly succeeded by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 175]</a></span>
experience of the more terrible reality. The place of
the encampment was plainly visible, and the stockade
still standing, but no human being to break the
solitude. Man could not suffer a more crushing
disappointment; and it is not surprising to hear that
Burke now completely broke down. But, after a
short interval, one ray of hope sprang up from the
depth of despair. A marked tree happened to catch
the eye of one of the explorers, which contained the
inscription, "Dig three feet westward." Wills and
King immediately began to excavate, but Burke was
too much unmanned to render any assistance. The
hole was found to contain a chest with some supplies
and a letter of explanation. This unhappy day in
the experience of the explorers was the 21st of April,
and the letter was eagerly opened to ascertain what
time Brahe and his men had left. The date was also
the 21st of April, at noon&mdash;in fact, the ink was
scarcely dry, for the letter had been written only
seven hours before it fell into the hands of Burke.
It stated, in explanation, that they had remained in
the dep√¥t four months; that Wright had not come
with the supplies from Menindie; that the blacks
were troublesome and their own provisions exhausted.
Moreover, as Burke had engaged to return in three
months, they considered, at the end of four, that he
must have perished or taken another route.</p>

<p>What was to be done? To remain in the abandoned
dep√¥t was to perish, for the amount of
provisions could only afford a very temporary relief.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Wills recommended an immediate move in the direction
of Menindie, on the track of Brahe and party;
but Burke was strongly in favour of making for
South Australia, whose pastoral stations now reached
as far as Mount Hopeless. At first sight there seemed
reason in this advice. Burke argued that it was
impossible to overtake Brahe in their emaciated condition;
that Menindie was 400 miles from the dep√¥t,
whereas Mount Hopeless was only 150; and that the
Barcoo River might be expected to supply them with
water for the most of the route. The course to Mount
Hopeless was accordingly adopted. Thinking the
dep√¥t might possibly be visited by a relief party, they
took the precaution of burying a letter at the foot of
the marked tree, stating the direction they had taken,
adding that their weak condition rendered it impossible
to travel more than four or five miles a day; but,
by a strange oversight, left no external indications
which would lead such a relief party to conclude that
the place had been visited by the explorers. Having
taken the handful of provisions, Burke, Wills and
King, together with the two surviving camels, started
for the most northern settlement of South Australia,
striving to make the shortest course, and coming on
to the river only when water failed them elsewhere.
One of the camels, unfortunately, got bogged, and had
to be shot, after two days' labour had been spent in
trying to extricate it. As much of its flesh as could
be recovered was dried and added to the small and
rapidly diminishing store of provisions. They managed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 177]</a></span>
to save a little, also, through an occasional present of
fish from the native tribes, who, fortunately, were
very friendly. But a great and unexpected misfortune
now befell the unhappy explorers. The Barcoo,
which had been reckoned on to supply them with
water, split up into several channels and lost itself in
the desert. One branch after another was followed
for some distance, but with no other result than the
consumption of their provisions and the loss of the
one surviving camel. They were now reduced to dire
extremity through want of both food and water, and
debated with themselves whether they should continue
the journey or return and encamp on the nearest
waterhole in the river, and endeavour to get subsistence
from the blacks. It was difficult to say how
much ground had been travelled over, but they
supposed it must be somewhere about 45 miles. In
reality it was about double that distance; and if they
could have made another good day's journey to the
south they would have seen Mount Hopeless raise its
friendly head above the horizon. But, by another of
those fatal decisions which haunted this expedition,
they resolved to abandon their journey and return to
the banks of the river. Fighting against despair even
yet, they conceived a faint hope that the dep√¥t might
have been visited in the interim, and Wills, with the
consent and advice of Burke and King, walked back,
as he was able, to see if any relief had arrived. He
reached the end of his journey on the 30th of May,
but found no one there, and saw no indications which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 178]</a></span>
could lead him to think the place had been visited
since his own party had left. Sorrowful at heart, but
brave in spirit to the last, Wills again retraced his
steps, and returned to his companions in a very
exhausted condition; but he could not have reached
them at all without the help of the blacks. All three
were now destitute, and, with the exception of an
occasional present of fish, had nothing in the shape of
provisions. But even yet there appeared to be one resort
which lay between them and death by starvation.
The country abounded with a plant called nardoo, the
seeds of which, when pounded and baked into a cake,
were eaten by the natives. The starving explorers
adopted the same practice, in the hope of still further
prolonging their existence. But a little experience
proved that the nardoo cakes, although allaying the
pangs of hunger, contained little nourishment, and the
heroic sufferers had now fallen into the last stage of
starvation. If they were to live at all, it was evident
they must cast themselves on the blacks, and trust to
their charity. Dreadful as the alternative was, they
agreed to adopt it, for life is sweet, even in the
wilderness. But just here an insuperable difficulty
intervened, for the blacks were not at hand and had
to be sought out. Burke and King had yet strength
to walk a mile, or perhaps two, in a day. But poor
Wills could walk no more, and yet he was willing
that his companions should go and save themselves, if
too late to save him. They put together a rude
shelter, and left to seek the blacks, after taking a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 179]</a></span>
sorrowful departure, which could hardly fail to be
final, for his life was visibly ebbing away. But they
were not to go far. On the second day Burke
succumbed, and felt his end to be at hand. He was a
brave man, yet he shrank from the idea of dying
alone, and entreated King to stay with him until all
was over. His dying request was religiously observed
by his trusty friend, who held him in his arms till he
breathed his last. Seeing he could render no more
assistance there, King returned to see how it was with
Wills. It was all peace, for he, too, lay quietly asleep
in the arms of Death. Beside his dead body lay his
journal, in which he had made his last entry with his
trembling hand, noting the aspect of the weather, and
added, with a stroke of pleasantry even yet, that he
was just like Mr. Micawber, waiting for something to
turn up. Such was the end of William John Wills,
the most amiable and noble-minded of Australia's
explorers. His life was one of singular promise, and
great things might have been expected from him had
he not, unhappily, perished in his youth. He was only
27 years of age when he fell a sacrifice to the incompetency
of others whom he served or trusted. The
disconsolate King was now alone in the wilderness,
with his dead leaders on either side of him. Having
performed his last duties to the departed, as best he
could, he sought and found his sable benefactors, who
received him as one of themselves, and proved by
their conduct that hospitality towards the distressed
is a virtue which even savages can exercise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 180]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Having seen the last of Burke and Wills, and left
King safe for the present in the hands of the friendly
aborigines, let us return to the Barcoo dep√¥t, in the
hope of finding some explanation of the mystery
which enshrouds that most unlucky centre of operations.
Brahe, as has been already noticed, took his
departure on the 21st of April, bound for Menindie.
He had travelled only eight days when Wright was
met coming on, <i>at last</i>, with the bulk of the supplies
for the expedition. After a brief consultation the
two leaders resolved to come on to the Barcoo dep√¥t,
which they reached in another eight days. Burke
and party had been there during the interval, but as
they left no external marks, Wright and Brahe, after
a few minutes' cursory examination, concluded the
dep√¥t had not been visited, and almost immediately
took their departure for Melbourne, without putting
themselves to the trouble of opening the hole at the
foot of the marked tree, where the explorers' letter
was concealed. Again the place was left without any
external indications for the direction of their friends,
who might return, and when the dep√¥t was visited by
Wills, about a fortnight later, he concluded, in the
absence of such indications, that no one had been
there since his own party left.</p>

<p>Almost everyone connected with this expedition is
to blame in some degree for the disasters in which it
ended. The committee at Melbourne went to sleep,
and were aroused to vigorous action when it was
too late. Burke and party were at fault in leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the dep√¥t for Mount Hopeless without making some
external marks which might catch the eye of anyone
who should come with supplies. Brahe and Wright
were guilty of unpardonable neglect in finally leaving
the Barcoo dep√¥t without opening the <i>cache</i>, to see
whether the dep√¥t chest of provisions had been taken
or not. But the real author of the disasters was
Wright, who loitered four months at Menindie, while
the heroic explorers were slowly dying of starvation.
He alleged in his defence that Burke had asked him
to remain until his own appointment was confirmed
by the Melbourne committee. But this is extremely
improbable, and is contradicted by Burke's own despatches.
For the shortcomings of the others a tolerable
excuse may be made, but for the cruel conduct
of Wright there is neither justification nor defence,
for all the evidence saddles him with the responsibility
of the horrible tragedy in which this once splendid
expedition closed its career.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3>SEARCH EXPEDITIONS IN QUEST OF BURKE AND WILLS.</h3>


<p>As time passed on and no trustworthy tidings of the
missing explorers could be obtained, anxiety on the
part of the Melbourne public became unbearable.
An active search was demanded with an urgency
which was not to be resisted. A manifold effort was
soon put forth on an unprecedented scale, and in this
enterprise Victoria was materially assisted by the
sister colonies. This combined action marks the meridian
of Australian exploration, which, when finished,
left little more to be done in the eastern half of the
continent. Within the space of two years&mdash;from 1860
to 1862&mdash;it was crossed no fewer than six times, in as
many different directions, by exploring parties. The
search expeditions all took the field about the same
time. Alfred Howitt was despatched from Melbourne
on the footsteps of Burke and Wills; John M'Kinlay
was sent from Adelaide to search the Barcoo and
surrounding districts; Frederick Walker was commissioned
to start from Rockhampton and proceed to
the north; while William Landsborough was instructed
to begin at Carpentaria, and examine the country to
the southward as far as might be necessary. With
a view to the support of all these parties, as opportunity
might offer, Captain Norman was sent with the
<i>Victoria</i> to form a relief dep√¥t on the Albert River,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 183]</a></span>
at the Gulf of Carpentaria. There are thus four
search expeditions which call for a brief review.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Mr. Alfred W. Howitt, son of William and Mary
Howitt, so well known to the literature of their
country, was sent from Melbourne to the Barcoo
(Coopers Creek), by the route which had been taken
by the missing expedition. Near Swan Hill he met
Brahe, returning with the intelligence that Burke
and Wills had not appeared at the dep√¥t. Proceeding
by way of Menindie and Poria Creek the Barcoo was
reached on the 8th September, 1861, and the dep√¥t at
Fort Wills on the 13th. The <i>cache</i>, on being opened,
was found to contain papers showing that the explorers
had been there since returning from Carpentaria.
The members of the expedition having
thereafter dispersed in different directions in quest of
information, one of them soon came back with the
welcome news that King had been found. The sequel
had better be given in Howitt's own words:&mdash;"I
immediately went across to the blacks' wurleys, where
I found King, sitting in a hut which the natives had
made for him. He presented a melancholy appearance,
wasted as a shadow, and hardly to be distinguished
as a civilized being but by the remnant of
clothes upon him. He seemed exceedingly weak, and
I found it occasionally difficult to follow what he said.
The natives were all gathered round, seated on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 184]</a></span>
ground, looking with a most gratified and delighted
expression. I camped where the party had halted,
on a high bank, close to the water, and shall probably
remain here ten days, to recruit King before returning."
The story, as given by King, is soon told.
From the time he saw his companions dead to the day
he was discovered by Howitt's party he had been
about two months and ten days in the wilderness.
He remained by himself some days before going to
the blacks. Upwards of two months had thus been
spent with the aborigines. Though desiring to be
quit of him at first, they afterwards became very
well reconciled to his company. On the whole they
behaved very well to the white stranger. As soon as
King was able to walk he proceeded seven miles
down the creek with the relief party, and showed
them the remains of Wills, which he had buried
under the sand. At a distance of about eight miles
further they found also the body of Burke, which
was now interred with due solemnity. The object of
the expedition having been thus accomplished, preparation
was made for the return to Melbourne, but
before starting the camp of the natives was again
visited, and some presents distributed, in acknowledgment
of their humane treatment of the forlorn King.</p>

<p>Soon after this party returned home, a second
expedition was organized, under the same leader, to
bring the bodies of Burke and Wills to Melbourne.
After reaching the Barcoo, a considerable time was
spent in the further exploration of the surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 185]</a></span>
country. The Stony Desert was visited, and a horse
captured which had been lost by Captain Sturt 18 or
19 years before. Having at length taken possession
of the bodies, they first conveyed them to Adelaide,
by the route which the explorers, when living, had
wished in vain to travel. This part of the journey
was traversed in seven days. The remains of the two
men who had been the first to cross Australia were
thence conveyed to Melbourne, where they were
interred with every mark of respect for their noble
characters, and many a token of regret for the neglect
which had left them to perish in the wilderness.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Although the object which called forth all the
search expeditions was completely attained by the first
alone, it is yet worth while to give some attention to
the other three, on account of their indirect services
in the work of exploration. We shall take next in
order the South Australian effort. On the 16th of
August, 1861, Mr. John M'Kinlay was despatched
from Adelaide, with a party of 10 men, 4 camels, 24
horses, 12 bullocks, and 100 sheep. Blanchewater,
400 miles distant, was crossed at Baker's station.
The journey thence to Lake Hope was made through
a dry and stony country. From this part all the way
to Sturt's Stony Desert the country was poor, but
contained an abundance of lakes and creeks, which
were well supplied with fish. Leaving a dep√¥t at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Lake Buchanan, M'Kinlay set out for the Barcoo,
again passing through a region of lakes. In the
country now visited a number of natives were found
wearing pieces of European clothing. A white man's
grave was pointed out by the blacks and opened by
the explorers. It was really Gray's grave, but they
were as yet in ignorance of the true facts of the case,
and were, moreover, grossly misled by the aborigines,
who pointed to a lake and told them they had killed
and eaten white men there. M'Kinlay, hastily concluding
that this must have been the end of the
missing expedition, called the place Lake Massacre,
and reported accordingly to the authorities at Adelaide.
Fearing that they intended to make the like quick
despatch with himself and party, M'Kinlay commanded
his men to fire upon them, which made the whole lot decamp.
This was an unfortunate misapprehension, for
the blacks, instead of meaning to be hostile, were only
giving expression to their joy after a fashion of their
own. It was, in fact, the same tribe that had treated
King so well, and they must have been terribly surprised
by such an abrupt termination to friendly intercourse.
But, in the presence of such strangers as
they had encountered, it was a risky thing to boast of
killing and eating white men. Having returned to
the dep√¥t on Lake Buchanan, and thence sent to
Blanchewater for supplies, M'Kinlay received correct
information regarding the fate of the missing expedition.
There was, therefore, no need of doing anything
more in this connection; but, being well supplied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 187]</a></span>
all necessaries, he wisely resolved to continue his
journey of exploration across the continent. On the
17th of December they were again on the march,
heading in a north-easterly direction, which led them
through a country barren in soil, but abounding in
lakes much frequented by waterfowl. These lakes
were quite as much a distinguishing feature of this
region as the springs had been of the country discovered
by M'Douall Stuart to the east of Lake Eyre&mdash;soon
to be noticed. Further travelling was rendered
difficult, first by excessive rain, and next by intolerable
heat. Christmas Day was spent at a splendid lake,
called Jeannie, which was found to be the haunt of
innumerable waterfowl. Here many natives were observed
pounding the nardoo seed between two stones,
which was then baked and roasted on the ashes. At
this camping-ground good feed was found for the
stock, and the men also were supplied with abundance
of fish by the blacks. During the night their sable
neighbours proved rather too noisy, but when a rocket
was sent up it had the effect of causing a dead silence
till morning. The next stage led on to another lake,
but it was through a country containing little vegetation
except polygonum, samphire, and saltbush. One
journey more brought them to a magnificent lake,
which M'Kinlay called the Hodgkinson, after the
second leader of the expedition. A three-days' excursion
from this centre ended in the discovery of quite
a number of lakes, abounding in excellent fish. The
expedition had now spent four months in a region
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of lakes, full or dry, with many creeks and flooded
hollows. This was a great surprise in a country which
bordered so closely on Sturt's Stony Desert, and is
still one of the enigmas of the physical geography of
Australia. On the 6th of January a fresh departure
was made for the north, but, after weeks of fruitless
toil in the midst of a drought, a return had to be
made to Lake Hodgkinson, where it was resolved to
remain in camp till rain fell. During this enforced
delay M'Kinlay, unable to brook idleness, took a small
party and made an assault on Sturt's Stony Desert,
intimating that he might be absent for three weeks.
Four days proved to be quite enough, as he met with
nothing but dry lakes, red sand-hills, and bare stones,
although he had penetrated 57 miles into this solitude.
Having returned to the camp there was nothing but
the unpleasant experience of waiting for rain, while
the provisions were running down with an uncomfortable
rapidity. Here, too, the blacks, presenting
themselves in companies of 400 or 500, were anything
but agreeable neighbours. The explorers also had to
put up with heat, flies, ill-health, and all manner of
inconveniences, till the 10th of February, when rain
came and released them from confinement. They had
now to flounder in the mud through a country which
is described as utterly bare of grass, like a field which
had been ploughed and harrowed, but not sown. On
the 13th an old camp of Burke's was passed, and by
the 7th of next month Sturt's Stony Desert was
left behind their backs. Towards the middle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 189]</a></span>
March some tracts of well-grassed country were
reached, and named the Downs of Plenty. During the
remainder of this month, also, they traversed a
tolerably good country, which seemed, however, to be
bordered by deserts. Tropical Australia was now
entered upon, and during the whole of April the
course lay through the most luxuriant vegetation.
About the beginning of May the track of Burke on
the Cloncurry was crossed. The Leichhardt River
was reached during the same month. Here the
country was simply magnificent, the grass being up to
the horses' necks. Another stage brought the expedition
to Stokes's Plains of Promise. Finally, on the
18th, they advanced to the tidal waters of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, but dense forests of mangrove forbade
their approach to the shore. Under date of the 19th
of May, and while resting in the 60th camp, M'Kinlay
wrote as follows:&mdash;"I consider we are now about four
or five miles from the coast. There is a rise in the
river here of six and two-thirds feet to-day, but
yesterday it was a foot higher. Killed the three
remaining sheep, and will retrace our steps on the
21st." These were the last of the 100 sheep which
were started with the expedition. M'Kinlay had the
credit of being the first to take sheep across the
continent of Australia. They now made for the coast
of the Pacific, which was struck at Port Denison, but
not till a thousand obstacles were overcome and nearly
all the camels and horses eaten to keep themselves
alive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 190]</a></span>
</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>On the same errand Mr. Frederick Walker, Commander
of Native Police, was sent from Rockhampton
to the Albert River by the Queensland authorities.
Taking a party of mounted troopers, he proceeded to
Bauhinia Downs, on the Dawson, where the expedition
was finally organized on the 7th September, 1861.
The River Nogoa was reached on the 16th, after
which he pushed on through Walker's Pass to the
River Nivelle. By the 27th he had made the Barcoo,
which was followed down for three days, during which
traces both of Gregory and Leichhardt were discovered.
From the Barcoo a passage was made to the Alice
through much spinifex country. After crossing the
watershed between the Alice and the Thomson, a fine
tributary of the latter, called the Coreenda, was met
with. By the 16th of October they had got into a
country of high mountains, where the natives were
observed to be armed with iron axes and tomahawks.
Some traces of Leichhardt were also found in this
quarter. The advance was now continued through a
hilly country in a north-west direction to lat. 21¬∞,
where they fell in with the head-waters of the Barkly,
a large tributary, or a main section, of the Flinders
River, which led them through splendid country.
Another fine tributary of the Flinders was soon after
discovered, and called the Norman, in honour of the
captain of that name who was in command of the
dep√¥t on the Albert. Nothing further of special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 191]</a></span>
interest occurred till the 30th of October, when they
were attacked by a large party of armed natives.
Walker commanded his men to fire upon them, when
a dozen of these unfortunate creatures fell under his
guns. There is reason to fear that the leader's experience
as an officer of black troopers had led him to
hold the lives of the aborigines too cheap and to forget
that they were human beings, of the same blood and
brotherhood as ourselves. The explorers now followed
the Norman River, but had to dig in its channel for
water. On the 25th of November they reached the
junction of the Norman and the Flinders, the latter
of which being a large and beautiful river. Here the
track of Burke and Wills was discovered, leading
south, but could not be followed till fresh supplies
were obtained from the dep√¥t on the Albert. Early in
December the expedition came on to the Leichhardt,
and then to the Albert River, the latter flowing over
plains and flooded low flats, where the tracks of
several other explorers were seen. On the 7th the
dep√¥t was reached and found to be under the superintendence
of Captain Norman. Walker had thus
made the journey in three months and twelve days
from Rockhampton. In point of celerity, our annals
of exploration contain nothing to beat this record.
After passing thirteen days at the dep√¥t, Walker
started anew to follow up the track of Burke and
Wills which he had been fortunate enough to discover.
He succeeded in running it southward to the ninth
camp of the missing expedition, when it ceased to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 192]</a></span>
discernible, in consequence of the abundance of vegetation
and the obliterating action of floods. Thinking
Burke had turned off to make for the east coast, Walker
altered his course to the same quarter, and made a
vain attempt to follow him up. After much harassing
travel he struck the Burdekin River, at Strathalbyn
station, where his troubles came to an end. Making
next for Port Denison, he proceeded thence to Rockhampton,
which was reached on the 5th of June. The
journey had thus occupied five months and two weeks.
Burke and Wills were not found, of course, but much
good country was discovered and the geography of
Northern Australia materially advanced.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The last of these efforts to bring relief to the missing
explorers was Mr. William Landsborough's expedition.
The honour of being a <i>search</i> party has frequently
been denied to this enterprise. Landsborough was
plainly accused of having interested objects in view;
and it must be confessed that his journal contains little
to refute this charge, for it scarcely ever alludes to
Burke and Wills, nor would any reader be likely to
suspect that its author was in search of anyone in
particular. Be this as it may, in cannot be doubted
that, in all other respects, this expedition was a most
fortunate one, and excelled all the rest in the extent
of fine country which it brought to light. To the
leader himself it must have seemed more like a vacation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 193]</a></span>
tour than a perilous journey through an unknown
land. With a party of three white men and three
blacks, Landsborough sailed from Moreton Bay to
Carpentaria on the 24th of August, 1861. Starting
from the shores of the Gulf, he explored the Albert
River, under different names, for about 120 miles.
This tract of country being exceedingly dry, and the
blacks troublesome, he was compelled to return to the
dep√¥t on the Albert. Captain Norman told him that
Walker had been there reporting the discovery of
Burke's track on the Flinders. This route was
accordingly followed from the Gulf to the source of
the river, but neither the tracks of Walker nor Burke
were found. After leaving the Flinders, the Thomson
was followed, and then Cooper's Creek (Barcoo) was
reached on the 19th of April. From this position to
the settled districts a route was found without difficulty&mdash;indeed,
with great ease to Landsborough. On
the 21st of May, being 103 days from the start,
Williams's station, on the Warrego, was reached,
where intelligence was first received regarding the fate
of Burke and Wills. The remainder of the journey
across the continent was made by the Darling River
and Menindie to Melbourne. It proved of the highest
value to the squatting interest, and led to the occupation
of an immense extent of country for squatting
purposes. After an experience of twenty years in
Australia, Landsborough testified that the best land
he had seen was in the district of Carpentaria.</p>

<h3>JOHN M'DOUALL STUART'S EXPEDITIONS IN THE
SOUTH, TO THE CENTRE, AND ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</h3>


<p>The brave adventurer who is next to engage our
attention must be placed in the front rank of explorers.
John M'Douall Stuart was excelled by none,
and equalled by few, in the special qualities which
command success in the arduous enterprise to which
he devoted his life. As a practical bushman he
probably stands without a rival. From first to last
he spent over twenty years in the exploration of
Australia, during which time he was the leader of six
expeditions, in all of which he made important
discoveries, and never failed to bring home his men,
who had put their lives in his keeping. He first
served under a great master, Captain Sturt, whom he
accompanied in the capacity of draughtsman to the
expedition which started for the centre of Australia
in 1844. His own responsible and eminently successful
labours in the same field will be sketched in
the sequel. It is not too much to claim for M'Douall
Stuart the palm of martyrdom in the cause which lay
so near his heart. It is true that after his work was
done he was not left without honours, and also
rewards, both in land and money, but by that time he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 195]</a></span>
had lost the capacity for enjoying any of these things.
From his last journey he returned, or rather was
carried, more dead than alive, racked with the pains
of scurvy, contracted in the centre of the continent,
which he was the first to discover. He subsequently
rallied a little, but never recovered his health, and
died in England in 1869.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The first of Stuart's journeys was undertaken on
the solicitation, and also at the expense, of his friend
Mr. Wm. Finke, and had for its object the discovery
of new pastoral country in the unknown territory to
the west and north-west of Lake Torrens. On the
10th of June, 1858, Stuart started from Mount Eyre
with only two men, a white man and a blackfellow,
taking with him a small complement of horses and a
too scanty allowance of provisions. The first section
of the journey, which was rugged and sterile, lay to
the west of Lake Torrens, whose surface was occasionally
sighted. Water was found at moderate
distances on this part of the route, but the rough and
stony country proved a serious difficulty to the horses,
which were imperfectly shod. This contingency had
been strangely overlooked, and no shoes had been
provided for the journey. The blackfellow, who was
supposed to know this country intimately, soon got
bewildered, and proved of no service for the purpose
he was intended to forward. The leader, being thus
thrown upon his own resources, was also greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 196]</a></span>
inconvenienced in shaping his course by the frequent
and extraordinary illusions of the mirage of the
desert. Referring to one of these perplexing occasions
he says:&mdash;"I think we have now made the dip of the
country toward the south, but the mirage is so powerful
that little bushes appear like great gum-trees, which
makes it very difficult to judge what is before us; it
is almost as bad as travelling in the dark. I never
saw it so bright or so continuous as it is now; one
would think the whole country was under water."
Failing to obtain the object of his search in the north-west,
Stuart now directed his journey to the south
and east, exploring the central region between Lake
Torrens and Lake Gairdner. In this quarter some
small patches of fairly good country were found, but
the water, in the few places where it was met with,
proved to be as bitter as the sea. The blackfellow
now, thinking it time to shift for himself, took the
way that pleased him best, leaving only the white
man, Foster, to assist Stuart in the thick of his
difficulties. Hope of a successful issue to their
labours was now fast ebbing from the breasts of these
indomitable adventurers. After journeying hither
and thither for 1,000 miles, they had failed in the
prime object of the expedition, their provisions were
rapidly disappearing, and the horses were too footsore
to travel an ordinary day's march. At this stage the
monotony of the scene was broken by a high mountain
coming into view, which Stuart named Mount
Finke, and from the summit of which he ventured to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 197]</a></span>
hope for a better prospect, or, if not, to alter his course.
"If I see nothing from the top of the mount to-morrow,"
said he, "I must turn down to Fowler's
Bay for water for the horses.... As I could not
remain quiet, I got on one of the lower spurs of Mount
Finke to see what was before me. The prospect is
gloomy in the extreme. I could see a long distance,
but nothing met the eye but a dense scrub, as black
and dismal as midnight." From this mount, accordingly,
a straight course was steered to the sea-coast,
during which every camping-place is marked on the
map by the name of "desert." In the matter of
provisions, they had for some time been reduced to
one meal a day, and toward the close of the journey
it was found that only two more remained to carry
them a distance of 100 miles. In this dire extremity
they were glad to feed on kangaroo mice, which,
happily, were here to be found in great abundance.
They are described as elegant little creatures, about
four inches in length, of the shape of a kangaroo, with
a tail terminating in a sort of brush. By means of
this resource against starvation the explorers were
enabled to cross the remaining stages of the desert,
and so reached the habitations of civilized men.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Mr. Stuart was the first explorer who reached the
centre of Australia. The journey which led to this
memorable achievement is worthy of detailed narration;
but before entering upon this story it may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 198]</a></span>
proper to say a few words on two preliminary essays
in exploration, which, in some measure, opened the
way to this much-desired result.</p>

<p>About six months after his return from his first
expedition, this indefatigable explorer started on a
new journey to examine the extensive territory lying
to the north of Lake Torrens and the east of Lake
Eyre. This country proved, in some respects, a
surprise to Australian discovery. It turned out to be
unusually well watered, being furrowed at moderate
intervals by a series of creeks, some of which were
entitled to the name of rivers. But its most astonishing
feature consisted in the myriads of springs, in
groups ranging from two or three to more than a
dozen in number. Some of these sent forth a stream
of water which might have turned a mill-wheel, and
continued to run a mile from the source. From
this circumstance the whole territory has, not inaptly,
been called the "spring" country. Another dominant
feature was seen in the extraordinary abundance of
quartz reefs, many of which bore plain indications of
being auriferous, but, of course, could not be fairly
tested by any appliances which were then to hand.
Towards the close of the same year (1859) another
journey was made to this part of Australia, when more
accurate surveys were obtained, and the boundaries of
a number of squatting runs laid down. In both of
these expeditions important service was rendered to
the better knowledge of this country, but they were
especially valuable as furnishing Stuart with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 199]</a></span>
advanced starting-point for his heroic project of
crossing the continent from south to north. This
arduous, but happily successful, enterprise will now
be described in its main outlines.</p>

<p>This expedition, which consisted of only three men
and thirteen horses, set out on the 2nd of March, 1860,
from Chambers's Creek, a valuable water supply
which had been discovered by Stuart in 1858. For
some time his course lay through an extensive tract
of country which, though yet unoccupied, had become
well known to this, its first explorer. Toward the
northern part they followed the River Neale, which
furnished plenty of water, and led them into the
unknown country. The next important creeks to
be discovered and crossed were the Hamilton, the
Stephenson, and the Finke. After crossing the latter
there began to heave into sight a strange and striking
mountain structure, which presented the appearance
of a locomotive engine with its funnel. "We proceeded,"
says the journal, "towards this remarkable
pillar through heavy sand-hills covered with spinifex,
and, at 12 miles from last night's camp, arrived at it.
It is a pillar of sandstone, standing on a hill upwards
of 100 feet high. From the base of the pillar to its
top is about 150 feet, quite perpendicular, and it is 20
feet wide by 10 feet deep, with two small peaks on
the top. I have named it Chambers's Pillar, in honour
of James Chambers, Esq., who has been my great
supporter in all my explorations." Much good
country had been traversed before this point was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 200]</a></span>
reached; indeed, the whole of this route was a surprise
in this respect, as it had been expected to land
them in a great central desert. Instead of finding a
barren wilderness, the continuation of the journey
brought them into another splendid tract, watered
by a creek named the Hugh, which, after being
followed for a long distance, terminated in a high
mountain-chain. To scale its rugged flanks and
penetrate the dense thickets of mulga proved to be a
most formidable task, their clothes and skin being
torn in forcing a passage through the living and the
dead timber. This range&mdash;the James&mdash;was succeeded
by two other chains, which were named the Waterhouse
and the M'Donnell Ranges, the latter of which
have since become a well-known landmark in the
history of more recent explorations. Stuart thus
describes the view he obtained from the north gorge
of these mountains:&mdash;"From the foot of this for about
five miles is an open grassy country, with a few small
patches of bushes. A number of gum-tree creeks
come from the ranges and seem to empty themselves
in the plains. The country in the ranges is as fine a
pastoral hill-country as a man could wish to possess&mdash;grass
to the top of the hills, and abundance of water
through the whole of the ranges." Still heading
northward, the expedition reached a position, on the
22nd of April, which is very memorable in the annals
of Australia. The goal which had proved the incitement
to so many sacrifices during a long period of our
history was now reached at last. Mr. Stuart was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 201]</a></span>
standing in the centre of the continent. This achievement,
of which he might well have been proud, is
intimated by the following modest entry in his
diary:&mdash;"To-day I find by my observation of the sun&mdash;111¬∞
0' 30''&mdash;that I am now camped in the centre of
Australia. I have marked a tree and planted the
British flag there. There is a high mount about
two miles and a half to north-north-east. I wish it
had been in the centre; but on it, to-morrow, I will
raise a cone of stones and plant the flag there and
name it Central Mount Stuart." This ceremony was
performed on the day following, when a fine view was
obtained from the summit of this, high mountain. The
aspect of the central region of Australia must have
been a surprise to the first discoverer, for it falsified
the prophecies of half a century. The centre of
Australia was as much a matter of curiosity and
conjecture in our early history as the North Pole is
at the present time. Oxley was first in the field, with
his pet theory of an inland sea. This conjecture
received its quietus from Sturt, but it was only to
make room for the opposite fallacy of a stony desert.
Now, at last, when the veil was lifted and the reality
disclosed, it turned out to be just that which nobody
had prophesied and few had ventured to expect. It
was simply a fine country, abounding in grass, and
fairly supplied with water. Both now and afterwards
it was used by Stuart as a recruiting-ground for his
toil-worn expedition. Leaving part of his little force
here for the present, the leader made a tentative effort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 202]</a></span>
to ascertain whether there was any practicable route
out west to the Victoria River. Finding none, he
returned, and kept steering his former course. As if
the centre had been the natural goal of the journey,
he met with nothing but difficulties in the attempt to
penetrate further to the north. He himself had fallen
a victim to scurvy, which was only slightly relieved
by the native cucumber, his only resource. Water
became even harder to find. The horses, also, which
were too much of the cart breed, did not well stand a
hard pinch. Above all, the blacks, who had never
been friendly, became the more hostile the further the
expedition advanced. The crisis was reached when
they made an encampment on Attack Creek. Here
the aborigines set fire to the grass, and tried every
stratagem to separate the explorers from their horses,
after which there would soon have been an end to the
expedition. Failing in this device, they next mustered
their forces and attacked the strangers in the
proportion of ten to one. Even so, they had to come
off second best for the time being. Nevertheless,
Stuart deemed it scarcely prudent to oppose himself
to a tribe of warlike blacks in the centre of Australia,
with an army consisting of two men, all told,
himself being commander-in-chief. Nothing further
remained but to submit to the inevitable, which he
accordingly did, and returned to the most northern
settlements of South Australia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 203]</a></span>
</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Mr. Stuart reached Adelaide in October, 1860.
When it became known that he had encamped in the
centre of Australia and pushed his way considerably
further north, the public enthusiasm again rose to
fever heat in the cause of exploration. The Parliament,
which never failed in its duty in this business,
again came forward with a vote of ¬£2,500 to provide
for another and a larger expedition, which was
speedily organized, with the old and well-tried
explorer for its leader. He took with him seven
men, thirty horses, and thirty weeks' provisions. The
former route was followed, with a little deviation, as
far as Attack Creek, the scene of the previous repulse.
In all his journeys Stuart had the shrewdness to
search out and follow up mountain-systems, as being
the physical conformation most likely to furnish the
needful supply of water. Still on the look-out for
this good fortune, Attack Creek had not been far left
in the rear when an elevated chain&mdash;the Whittington
Range&mdash;was discovered, and followed for a long distance.
It led them on to Tomkinson's Creek,
containing a large supply of water, which served as
a base for immediate operations, and was afterwards
turned to good account as a retreat in time of
difficulty. Another mountain-system&mdash;named the
Warburton&mdash;was met with in the next stage of the
journey. Like the former, it was heading too much
to the north to suit Stuart's intention of making for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the Victoria River, on the western coast. Breaking
away from the mountains, repeated attempts were
made to find a route in the required direction. The
high lands soon shaded away into an interminable,
but very fertile champaign country, which received
the name of Sturt's Plains, in honour of the "father
of Australian exploration." But it proved to be
absolutely arid, and blocked on all sides by impenetrable
scrubs, varied only by low red sand-hills.
Through these impervious scrubs, on the west, a
passage would have to be forced, or the expedition
must end in failure. The latter alternative was not
to be thought of till every expedient had been exhausted.
Leaving a portion of his force in the dep√¥t,
Stuart, three several times, started with a light party
to pierce his way through the most forbidding obstacles
he had ever experienced in his journeys. It was with
the greatest difficulty the horses could be brought to
face this formidable barrier; and when forced to do
so, the animals were injured and the explorers' clothes
torn to shreds. It was hard to persevere in the face
of such sacrifices; yet it was done manfully enough,
and might have been crowned with success but for
the absolute failure of water. The furthest point
reached in these assaults on the impervious west was
only a hundred miles distant from Gregory's last
camp on the Camfield; and if this short space could
have been bridged over the final aim of the expedition
would have been easily attained. To accomplish
this object, Stuart did all that man could do in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 205]</a></span>
a situation. Nothing could be more admirable than
the pluck and perseverance displayed in this conflict
with the impossible. But he, too, like all mortals,
had to yield to stern necessity. With a heavy heart
he turned his back on the coveted north-west and
retreated to the old camping-ground on the Tomkinson.
Even yet unwilling to leave any alternative untried,
he now modified his plan, and proposed to strike
north for the Gulf of Carpentaria, if such a course
might be possible. This, unhappily, it proved not to
be. His path was effectually barred in this direction
also. After the most desperate effort nothing
remained but to abandon the enterprise and return to
the haunts of civilization. The following entry in
his journal shows with how much regret this retreat
was forced upon him:&mdash;"It certainly is a great disappointment
to me not to be able to get through, but
I believe I have left nothing untried that has been in
my power. I have tried to make the Gulf and the
river (Victoria) both before rain fell and immediately
after it had fallen, but the results were the same&mdash;<i>unsuccessful</i>.
I shall commence my homeward
journey to-morrow morning. The horses have had a
severe trial from the long journeys they have made,
and the great hardships and privations they have
undergone. On my last journey they were one
hundred and six hours without water." So ended
this second heroic effort to cross the continent. Notwithstanding
his defeat, Stuart had succeeded in
penetrating one hundred miles beyond the furthest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 206]</a></span>
point reached on the previous journey. His most
advanced position was lat. 17¬∞ long. 133¬∞.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Now, at last, we are to see the reward of perseverance.
If Fortune has any favour for the brave, it
was time to smile on John M'Douall Stuart. Two
noble efforts had ended in failure, but this third
attempt was to be crowned with complete success,
and land the explorer on the much-coveted shores of
the Indian Ocean. A month had not elapsed since
his return from the second journey when the Government
of South Australia despatched him on his third
and final expedition. Being provided with reinforcements,
he left the settled districts in January, 1862,
and by the 8th of April had reached Newcastle Water,
the most northern camping-ground of the former
journey. Without loss of time he made a renewed
attempt to pierce the north-western scrub and carve
his way to the Victoria River. But again his Herculean
struggles proved to be only wasted effort.
This route was accordingly abandoned, finally and for
ever, as being absolutely impracticable. The line of
march was now directed to the north, with a view
of cutting the track of Leichhardt's and Gregory's
discoveries, and thus gaining the Roper River, which
enters the Gulf of Carpentaria. This new project
proved more easy in the accomplishment than he had
ventured to expect. There were, of course, stubborn
obstacles to be overcome; but water, the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 207]</a></span>
requirement, was found at manageable intervals,
bringing the party on, by a succession of ponds, first
to the Daly Waters, and thence to an important river,
which was named the Strangway. This bridge over
the wilderness conducted them to the much-desired
Roper River. It is described as a noble stream,
draining a magnificent country, and exceeding in
volume any the explorers had hitherto seen. This
clue having been followed in the direction of its
source, led the expedition a long way towards its
destination on the shores of the Indian Ocean. After
it failed them by turning too far to the north, only a
short intervening tract had to be crossed before
the Adelaide River, one of the known western
streams, was reached. Again the route lay through
some of the finest country in Australia, containing
much that was new both in flora and
fauna. The valley of this river was constantly
revealing to the eyes of the strangers some botanical
surprise&mdash;giant bamboos, fairy-like palms, and
magnificent water-lilies on the placid bosom of its
longer reaches. There was only one drawback,
and that a rather serious one. It was the paradise
of mosquitoes, which made a common prey of the
intruders, allowing them no rest by night, and
leaving mementos of their attachment that could
not be forgotten during the day. But through
pleasure and pain the expedition pushed on towards
the attainment of its purpose. The leader
so managed the last stage as to make the conclusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of the journey a surprise to his men. He
knew the ocean to be near at hand, but kept the
good news a secret till his party should be in a
position to behold it with their own eyes. "At
eight miles and a half," says he, "we came upon a
broad valley of black alluvial soil, covered with
long grass. From this I can hear the wash of the
sea. On the other side of the valley, which is
rather more than a quarter of a mile wide, is
growing a line of thick heavy bushes, very dense,
showing that to be the boundary of the beach.
Crossed the valley and entered the scrub, which
was a complete network of vines. Stopped the
horses to clear a way, while I advanced a few
yards on the beach, and was gratified and delighted
to behold the waters of the Indian Ocean, in
Van Diemen's Gulf, before the party with the
horses knew anything of its proximity. Thring,
who rode in advance of me, called out 'The sea!'
which so took them all by surprise, and they were
so astonished, that he had to repeat the call before
they fully understood what was meant. They then
immediately gave three long and hearty cheers....
I dipped my feet and washed my hands,
as I had promised the late Governor, Sir Richard
McDonnell, I would do if I reached it. Thus I have,
through the instrumentality of Divine Providence,
been led to accomplish the great object of the
expedition, and to take the whole party safely as
witnesses to the fact, and through one of the finest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 209]</a></span>
countries man could wish to behold. From Newcastle
Water to the sea-beach the main body of the
horses have been only one night without water, and
then got it the next day." The Union Jack was now
hoisted, and near the foot of a marked tree there
was buried, in a tin, a paper containing the following
inscription:&mdash;"The exploring party under the command
of John M'Douall Stuart arrived at this spot on
the 25th day of July, 1862, having crossed the entire
continent of Australia, from the Southern to the
Indian Ocean, passing through the centre. They left
the city of Adelaide on the 26th day of October,
1861, and the most northern station of the colony on
the 21st day of January, 1862. To commemorate
this happy event they have raised this flag, bearing
his name. All well. God save the Queen!" Burke
and Wills had crossed the same continent to the
Gulf of Carpentaria nearly eighteen months earlier,
but this achievement in no way detracts from the
merit of Stuart's success, for his journey was entirely
independent of their, or any other, expedition. The
felicitous termination of this splendid enterprise
marks a principal era in the history of Australian
exploration. It led directly to three important results&mdash;the
annexation of the northern territory to South
Australia, the establishment of a colonial settlement
at Port Darwin, and the construction of the transcontinental
telegraph along almost the whole route of
this expedition.</p>

<h3>COLONEL WARBURTON'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE
WESTERN INTERIOR.</h3>


<p>M'Douall Stuart's crowning feat in exploration was
soon turned to good account. The idea of a transcontinental
telegraph now passed from the realms of
Utopia and became a realized fact. The commercial
interests of Australia had been urgently in need of
communication with the Indo-European lines already
existing, but the great desert of the interior was
believed to interpose an impenetrable barrier. Now,
at last, this misconception, which had been founded
on ignorance, was removed by Stuart, who discovered
a belt of good country stretching across the interior
and reaching to the Indian Ocean. Along this route,
with few deviations, the line runs from the Adelaide
extension in the south to Port Darwin in the north.
In this most creditable enterprise, which was completed
in 1872, South Australia spent ¬£370,000,
and rendered excellent service to the exploration, as
well as to the commercial interests, of Australia. Here
was a new base-line for explorers, intersecting the
continent from end to end. This advantage was not
long in being put to practical use. In South Australia
the question of further exploration began to be
agitated as soon as the line was opened. The Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 211]</a></span>
was importuned for means to provide for an
expedition to cut through the western interior,
starting from the telegraph line at the centre of the
continent. No aid was obtained from this quarter;
nevertheless, the projected tour of discovery did not
fall through, for two private gentlemen, the Hon.
Thomas Elder and Mr. W. W. Hughes, now came
forward and offered to bear the expense of the expedition.
The next important step was the choice of a
leader, who was happily found in Colonel P. E.
Warburton. This brave man was born in Cheshire,
England, in 1813. He was early trained for the
military profession, and served in India from 1831 to
1853. About the latter date he came out to South
Australia, where he was appointed Commissioner of
Police, and subsequently held the position of Commandant
of the volunteer forces till 1874. During
these later years he had been engaged in several
essays in exploration, in which he rendered good
service to his country and prepared himself for the
perilous, but successful, journey with which his name
will ever be associated.</p>

<p>The proper starting-point for the expedition was
fixed for Alice Springs, a station on the overland telegraph,
situated almost in the centre of Australia; and
it was the leader's intention to make for the city of
Perth, in the west, by the most direct course that could
be found&mdash;a purpose which came to be considerably
modified under the pressure of a terrible necessity.
The rendezvous, 1,120 miles distant from Adelaide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 212]</a></span>
was reached by way of Beltana, along a route now
beginning to be pretty well known, and all was
prepared for the start by the 15th of April, 1873. The
expedition, now first in the line of march, consisted of
Colonel Warburton as leader, R. Warburton (his son),
J. W. Lewis, D. White, two Afghans, and a black
boy. The only beasts of burden were camels, which
amounted to seventeen in number, and the supply of
provisions was calculated to last for six months. The
route for a short distance northward kept the line of
the telegraph, till the Burt Creek was reached, after
which it deflected toward the west. The difficulties
which beset this journey began at the beginning and
continued to its close, only increasing in severity with
terrible consistency. Want of water compelled them
again and again to retreat to former encampments,
thus causing a great part of the route to be travelled
over two or three times. From this cause the eastern
boundary of South Australia had to be crossed three
times before permanent progress could be made in the
proper course. From first to last the country proved
to be a barren waste, without creek or river affording
a supply of water. In the earlier part of the journey
an occasional oasis was met with containing permanent
lakelets, at which the explorers would gladly
have lingered to recruit themselves and rest the
camels; but this delay meant consumption of the
provisions, which it soon became evident were too
scanty from the first. Warburton wisely resolved to
feel his way as he proceeded through the desert by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 213]</a></span>
sending scouts in advance to search for water. This
was seldom found, except in extremely sparse wells,
which were used by the aborigines, and sometimes
indicated by the smoke of their camps, but in
hardly a single instance was direct information
obtained from the blacks. The native wells in the
sand not unusually indicated, rather than contained,
water, and had often to be excavated to much greater
depth. In this way, for the most part, was the desert
crossed. When water was announced, an advance
was made one stage further and a search party again
sent out. It often happened that no water could be
found by the scouts after the most exhausting search,
further progress being thus rendered impossible. In
these cases there was no help for it but to change the
direction, as far as their object would permit, and
seek another tentative route. This was indescribably
trying to their spirits, but the other alternative was
to perish in the sand. On some few occasions the
clouds came to their relief and burst in thunderstorms.
Even when only a slight shower fell, a few buckets of
water were secured by spreading a tarpaulin on the
ground. On the 9th of May a deep glen was found
in a range of hills. Here was an excellent supply of
water, shaded by basalt rocks, rising to the height of
300 ft. Here, too, the weary wanderers rested for a
few days, as also at Waterloo Wells, a little ahead, for
which they had to pay a penalty in the permanent
loss of four camels, which suddenly decamped. They
were tracked for a hundred miles, but never recovered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Hitherto their progress had been slow and discouraging.
They had travelled 1,700 miles, but were
yet at no great distance from Alice Springs. Nor
was the outlook any more encouraging. Day after
day it was the same weary journeying over spinifex
ridges and sandy valleys, without any indication of
the fine country they had hoped to discover; but, to
their credit be it said, no one even hinted about giving
up the enterprise. By the 17th of August a notable
stage in their progress was reached. Warburton
ascertained that he could not be more than ten
miles distant from the most southern point reached
by Mr. A. C. Gregory in 1856. The Colonel ascended
a neighbouring hill to see if he could catch a glimpse
of Termination Lake, into which Sturt's Creek had
been found to empty itself. This salt lake was concealed
by a range of sand-hills; but Warburton
verified his position, and thus had virtually connected
his own survey from the centre with the Gregory
discoveries in the north. Advancing slowly, but
surely, towards the west, a fine freshwater lake
was discovered on the 30th. It abounded in waterfowl,
which were more easily shot than recovered,
as they had no means of reaching them in the
water. From this point onward their troubles began
to thicken with ominous rapidity. Eight of the
seventeen camels were gone, while the stock of provisions,
too, began to appear uncomfortably small, and
had to be dealt out with a niggardly hand. It now
became evident to the Colonel that the original plan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of proceeding to Perth was impracticable, and he
resolved to head further to the north, so as to strike
the Oakover River and save the expedition. Their
troubles were truly most afflicting in this great and
terrible wilderness. The heat and toil of travelling
wore them out by day, and myriads of black ants
deprived them of their sleep at night. They were
now living on camels' flesh, dried in the sun, the only
sauce being an occasional bird which fell to their guns.
By the 2nd of November they had been reduced to
dire extremity, both of famine and thirst. The Oakover
was estimated to be about 150 miles distant, and
it was resolved to make a rush for it, taking their
chance of an accidental discovery of water to keep
them in life, for it was now a question of mere
life and death. Respecting this latter and awfully
perilous stage of the journey, it will be better to let
Colonel Warburton speak for himself. The following
extracts are from the entries in his journal as made
during the crisis of his sufferings, when hope was fast
giving place to despair:&mdash;"We killed our last meat
on the 20th October; a large bull camel has, therefore,
fed us for three weeks. It must be remembered
that we have had no flour, tea, or sugar, neither have
we an atom of salt, so we cannot salt our meat. We
are seven in all, and are living entirely upon sun-dried
slips of meat which are as tasteless and innutritious
as a piece of dead bark.... We have
abandoned everything but our small supply of water
and meat, and each party has a gun.... We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 216]</a></span>
are hemmed in on every side: every trial we make
fails; and I can now only hope that some one or
more of the party may reach water sooner or
later. As for myself, I can see no hope of life, for
I cannot hold up without food and water. I have
given Lewis written instructions to justify his leaving
me, should I die, and have made such arrangements
as I can for the preservation of my journal
and maps.... My party, at least, are now in
that state that, unless it please God to save us, we
cannot live more than 24 hours. We are at our last
drop of water, and the smallest bit of dried meat
chokes me. I fear my son must share my fate, as he
refuses to leave me. God have mercy upon us, for
we are brought very low, and by the time death
reaches us we shall not regret exchanging our present
misery for that state in which the weary are at rest.
We have tried to do our duty, and have been disappointed
in all our expectations. I have been in
excellent health during the whole journey, and am so
still, being merely worn out from want of food and
water. Let no self-reproaches afflict any respecting
me. I undertook this journey for the benefit of my
family, and I was quite equal to it under all the
circumstances that could be reasonably anticipated,
but difficulties and losses have come upon us so
thickly for the last few months that we have not
been able to move. Thus, our provisions are gone;
but this would not have stopped us could we have
found water without such laborious search. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 217]</a></span>
country is terrible. I do not believe men ever
traversed so vast an extent of continuous desert."
They were, indeed, brought to the last extreme of
misery. But man's extremity is God's opportunity.
A search party found a good well about twelve miles
distant, which supplied all their necessities, and saved
their lives. Another fortnight brought the forlorn
wanderers to a creek with a good store of water at
intervals. This proved to be a tributary of the Oakover,
to the banks of which they were thus led by
such stages as could be travelled in their deplorably
emaciated condition. The outskirts of civilization
were all but reached. The pastoral station of De Grey
was believed to be only a few days' travelling down
the river, and a small detachment was sent to implore
succour. The distance was really 170 miles, and three
weary weeks had to be spent in hoping against
hope till relief arrived. Help did come in abundance,
and as speedily as was possible in the circumstances.
The toils of the wilderness wanderings were now
over; all that remained was a terrible retrospect.
It was reckoned they had not travelled less
than 4,000 miles, including deviations and retreats
when further advance became impracticable through
want of water. The result, looked at from an
explorer's point of view, was, of course, a flat disappointment.
Some had confidently expected to
hear of a good pastoral country being discovered
in the western interior which would prove a new
home to the enterprising squatter, and be depastured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 218]</a></span>
by myriads of flocks and herds. Instead of this
wished-for discovery, Colonel Warburton had to
follow in the wake of Captain Sturt, and tell yet
another tale of an arid desert with dreary ridges of
sand succeeding each other like the waves of the sea&mdash;a
country of no use to civilized, and very little to
savage, man. Yet, even so, a good service had been
rendered to the knowledge of Australian geography.
Where the truth has to be known it is something
even to reach a negative result. If the western
interior is a desert, it is a real gain to have this fact
ascertained and placed on record. Another question
set at rest by this expedition is the incomparable
superiority of camels in Australian exploration, in
point of endurance and in making long stages without
water. A horse requires to be watered every twelve
hours, but a camel will go without it for ten or
twelve days on a pinch. This was not the first time
they had been tried in Australia. Burke and
Wills started with more "ships of the desert" than
Warburton; but the mismanagement which involved
that enterprise in fatal disaster deprived the experiment
of a fair chance of success. Warburton's was
pre-eminently the camel expedition of Australia.
The result justified the means. With all the aid of
these invaluable beasts of burden the expedition,
indeed, was brought to the very brink of ruin;
but without them everyone must inevitably have
perished.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<h3>THE HON. JOHN FORREST'S EXPLORATIONS IN WESTERN
AUSTRALIA.</h3>


<p>This distinguished explorer is a native of West
Australia, and an honour to his country. He is a
man of ability, well educated, and thoroughly competent
for the work to which he has devoted so much
of his time and attention. In early life he entered
the Survey Department, where his services were
appreciated and rewarded by an appointment, in
1876, to the office of Deputy Surveyor-General. Mr.
Forrest has gained imperishable laurels in the field of
exploration. His services in the three following
expeditions entitle him to a high position among the
Australian explorers. A short notice of each is all
that our space permits.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>About the close of 1868 a report reached Perth to
the effect that natives in the eastern districts knew of
a party of white men who had been murdered some
twenty years earlier. This rumour was strongly
confirmed by a gentleman who had penetrated into
the interior in search of sheep-runs. He reported
that his native guide had assured him he had been to
the very spot where the murder had been committed,
and had seen the remains of white men. His story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 220]</a></span>
was very circumstantial, stating that it was on the
border of a large lake, and that the white men were
killed while making damper. He volunteered, moreover,
to conduct any party to the scene of the murder.
The story possessed a sufficient likeness to truth to
impose on grave and sober-minded men. Among
these was Baron Von Mueller, of Melbourne, who
organized a party to proceed to the spot, in the hope of
finding the remains of Leichhardt's expedition. He
intended to take the lead himself, but this purpose he
had to change, through business engagements, and the
expedition accordingly was placed under the command
of Mr. John Forrest. The route lay to the
north-east from Perth. The party was able to penetrate
250 miles in advance of former expeditions.
This was, so far, another gain to the knowledge of
Australian geography; but the new country was
found to be unsuitable for pastoral or agricultural
purposes. In regard to its principal object, the
expedition turned out a complete failure, adding
only one other proof of the utter worthlessness of
aboriginal testimony. The blackfellow who had led
them out with such confidence made some significant
admissions as they proceeded on the journey.
First, he had not, properly speaking, been at the place
himself, or seen the relics, but had heard of them from
others of the black fraternity; then, again, he could
not be sure whether they were the bones of men or
horses&mdash;more likely, perhaps, the latter. Finally, it
was pretty clearly ascertained that the whole story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 221]</a></span>
had originated from the remains of a number of
horses which had belonged to the explorer Austin, and
were poisoned in that neighbourhood. No traces of
Leichhardt were found in that quarter, nor is it at all
probable that he had penetrated so far west.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Almost immediately after returning from the search
after Leichhardt, Mr. Forrest was put in command of
a second expedition. Governor Weld was anxious to
obtain a more accurate survey of the southern coast
between Perth and Adelaide, with a view to telegraphic
connection. The largest and most difficult
part of the route lay along the Great Australian
Bight, which had been traversed with terrible suffering
by Mr. E. J. Eyre thirty years previously.
Since that time a little more information had been
gained, tending to lessen the horrors of travel in that
forbidding region; and Port Eucla, a valuable harbour,
had been discovered just within the eastern boundary
of West Australia. But the whole of the southern
country from Perth to Adelaide required to be
examined afresh for the object which was now
contemplated. Mr. John Forrest was easily persuaded
to lead this expedition, which consisted of his brother,
Mr. Alexander Forrest, as second in command, Police
Constable M'Larty, a farrier, and two aboriginals. A
small schooner, the <i>Adur</i>, was despatched, to wait
with supplies at Esperance Bay, Israelite Bay, and
Port Eucla&mdash;an arrangement which greatly lessened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the difficulties and dangers of the expedition. After
reaching the Great Bight the party followed, in a
reverse direction, the line of Eyre's journey, keeping
a little more inland, though they were never more
than thirty miles from the sea. So far as the old
explorer's tracks were followed, Forrest had the
advantage of finding an occasional supply of water as
indicated on the chart, and when he deviated from
this route he was well rewarded by the discovery
of better, and sometimes of really first-class country.
The season, though too dry, seems to have been less
so than when Eyre encountered the perils of this
region, and for this reason occasional surface water
was found, in very limited quantities. Yet on several
of the long waterless stages both men and horses were
near their last gasp in the agonies of thirst. From
Port Eucla an attempt was made to penetrate for
some distance to the north, in the interest of discovery.
The land appeared, and has since been
proved, to be of the best quality, but absolute want of
water compelled the explorers to beat a retreat when
they had proceeded only about thirty miles inland.
The expedition again started on its proper course and
rounded the head of the Bight. Soon an escort was
in readiness from South Australia, which led them
through the Gawler Ranges to the city of Adelaide.
The party had started on the 30th of March, 1870,
and their destination was reached on the 27th of
August&mdash;not half the time Mr. Eyre had required for
a much shorter journey. This new adventure in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 223]</a></span>
exploration was highly successful. A practicable
route for the telegraph having been found, the line
was constructed in the course of another year or two,
thus connecting Perth with the intercolonial and
also with the European telegraphic systems. Fine
reaches of the best pastoral country were examined
or indicated lying to the north of the wretched
seaboard, the only drawback being the absence of
permanent water. This difficulty is now being overcome
by boring, by which means an ample supply is
obtained at a reasonable depth. The latest proposal
is to run a railway from Perth to Port Eucla, with
probable extension to Adelaide. A syndicate has
offered to construct it on the land-grant system,
engineers are presently engaged on the survey, and
its completion may be accepted as one of the great
events of the near future.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Mr. John Forrest's third expedition was much more
arduous, as it was also of greater geographical importance,
than either of the preceding. Before the transcontinental
telegraph was fully completed, he proposed
to the authorities at Perth to lead an exploring party
across the centre of Western Australia from Champion
Bay to the route of the new line, on condition of a
grant from the Treasury of ¬£400 for expenses, himself
engaging to provide another ¬£200. The proposal
was gladly accepted, and no time was lost in making
the necessary preparations. His party, as finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 224]</a></span>
organized, consisted of Alexander Forrest, five whites,
two aboriginals, and twenty-one horses. It being
resolved to keep the line of the Murchison to its
sources, the start was made from Geraldton, Champion
Bay, on the 1st of April, 1874. For some time the
course lay to the south of the river, which was not
joined till the 23rd, after which beautifully grassed
country was travelled over. The Murchison in its
upper waters divided into several channels, causing
some perplexity. One of these was selected, and
followed as far as it served their purpose, and then
the course was directed to the watershed. Now they
found themselves in a dry, barren land, which afforded
the scantiest supply of water, and only after laborious
search&mdash;sometimes not even then. Occasionally, but
only at long intervals, a good native well was reached,
when the temptation to rest for several days was
irresistible. To the most noted of these Mr. Forrest
gave the name of the Weld Springs, in honour of the
Governor, who ever did his utmost to forward the
exploration of the interior. The encampment at Weld
Springs was not an unbroken pleasure. The blacks
were numerous in the neighbourhood, and irreconcilably
hostile. Finding his party assailed with murderous
intent, Forrest, seeing it had become a question
of self-defence, fired upon the natives, and some blood
was shed. But for this act of stern necessity, it is
evident that the explorers must have perished. This
pleasant spot was but an oasis in a great desert, which
became the more inhospitable the further they penetrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 225]</a></span>
into its secrets. For 600 miles they had to
thread their way through a wilderness of spinifex,
sometimes also approaching the verge of despair
through want of water, in search of which the scouts
had always to scour the country. In this desert the
natives were seldom seen, and still more rarely could
they be induced to come within speaking distance.
At one place they decamped on the first appearance
of the intruders on their desert home, leaving a whole
kangaroo roasting on the fire. This would have been
quite a godsend for Warburton and his party, but
happily the present expedition was never reduced to
such dire necessity. In another respect, too, Forrest
seems to have had better luck than his brother
explorers. During the latter part of his journey a
kind of fig-tree (<i>Ficus platypoda</i>) was occasionally
met with, producing an agreeable fruit about the size
of a bullet. Such a discovery in the wilds of Australia
is nothing short of a marvel. Nature has
reserved few such favours for this country. Yet still
better fortune was at hand. It became evident, first
by faint and then by very plain indications, that they
were coming on the tracks of Europeans. Only a
short time previously Mr. Giles and Mr. Gosse had
separately been out in these parts, but had to return
for want of water. Still, a marked tree or an old
camping-ground was an inspiring object, seeing they
had been made by travellers who had started from the
opposite end of the journey. Much yet remained to
be done, but the ground was now got over with much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 226]</a></span>
better heart. The monotony of the desert-wandering
had been much relieved in a manner highly creditable
to Mr. Forrest. Here, as in all his explorations, he
remembered the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Regularly,
as the Sunday came round, divine service was
read in the camp. Even the old habit of a good
Sunday dinner was not forgotten. People in different
circumstances might not have thought the cheer much
to be envied; but hunger is the best sauce. If a
pigeon or a parrot could be secured at the seasonable
time it was reserved as a special treat for the Sunday
dinner. But better things were in store. Perseverance
had not much longer to wait for its reward.
Following the tracks of the preceding explorers, they
came on to the Marryat River, which led them on to
the Alberga, and this clue finally conducted the weary
wanderers to the long-desired telegraph line. The
journal of the expedition contains the following entry
for the 27th August, 1874:&mdash;"Continued east for
about twelve miles, and then E.N.E. for three miles,
and reached the telegraph line between Adelaide and
Port Darwin, and camped." [The 104th camp from the
start.] "Long and continued cheers came from our
little band as they beheld at last the goal to which we
have been travelling for so long. I felt rejoiced and
relieved from anxiety; and in reflecting on the long
time of travel we had performed through an unknown
country, almost a wilderness, felt very thankful to
that good Providence that had guarded and guided us
so safely through it." A well-beaten track had now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 227]</a></span>
been made along the telegraph line, which the party
followed, proceeding to the south. In a day or two
the Peak station was reached. From this point
the journey to Adelaide was made by easy stages.
Forrest's track lay a long way south of Warburton's,
and threw a streak of light across another dark region
of the western half of Australia. The results of the
journey are thus summed up in the explorer's own
words:&mdash;"The whole of the country, from the settled
districts near Champion Bay to the head of the
Murchison, is admirably suited for pastoral settlement,
and in a very short time will be taken up and
stocked; indeed, some has already been occupied.
From the head of the Murchison to the 129th
meridian, the boundary of our colony, I do not think
will ever be settled. Of course, there are many grassy
patches, such as at Windich Springs, the Weld
Springs, all round Mount Moore, and other places;
but they are so isolated, and of such extent, that it
would never pay to take stock to them. The general
character of this immense tract is a gently undulating
spinifex desert&mdash;<i>Festuca (Triodia) irritans</i>, the
spinifex of the desert explorers, but not the spinifex
of science. It is lightly wooded ... and there
is a great absence of any large timber."</p>

<h3>MR. ERNEST GILE'S EXPLORATIONS IN CENTRAL AND
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.</h3>


<p>Mr. Ernest Giles is a native of Bristol, in England.
As soon as his education was finished he rejoined his
father and family, who had preceded him to Australia.
He very early developed a passion for exploration, and
gained valuable experience in connection with various
expeditions which he served in a subordinate capacity.
His own fame as an explorer rests securely on the
following enterprises:&mdash;</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Shortly after the construction of the Port Darwin
telegraph, Mr. Giles made a persevering attempt to
lead a small party from Chambers's Pillar to the
sources of the Murchison River. The expenses were
provided partly by himself and partly by Baron Von
Mueller, of Melbourne. The party consisted of
Messrs. Giles, Carmichael, and A. Robinson, with
fifteen horses and one dog. The start was made
about the middle of August, 1872. For the early part
of the journey the River Finke was followed, but it
led them into a rugged, mountainous country, in
which travelling was difficult. The scenery was often
charming, as one glen after another was explored.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Palm-Tree Glen, in particular, called forth unceasing
admiration on account of the multitude of wild flowers
which were "born to blush unseen and waste their
sweetness on the desert air." "I collected to-day,"
says Mr. Giles, "and during the other days since we
have been in this glen, a number of most beautiful
flowers, which grow in profusion in this otherwise
desolate glen. I am literally surrounded by fair
flowers of many a changing hue. Why Nature should
scatter such floral gems in such a sterile region is
difficult to understand; but such a variety of lovely
flowers of every colour and perfume I have never met
with previously. They alone would have induced me
to name this the Glen of Flowers, but having found in
it also so many of the stately palm-trees, I have called
it the Glen of Palms." During a further advance
among the outlying spurs of the M'Donnell Ranges,
the Finke was left, or lost, and laborious search
had often to be made for water. The mountains
were high, but no creek was found with a longer
course than twelve miles. The peaks often assumed
strange and fantastic shapes, as the explorers have
indicated by such names as Mount Peculiar, Haast's
Bluff, &amp;c. The following quotation from the journal
shows how they were straitened at this time through
want of water. After finding a little in the hollow of
a rock, just sufficient to save life, Mr. Giles says:&mdash;"It
was necessary to try to discover more water if
possible, so, after breakfast, I walked away, but, after
travelling up gullies and gorges, hills and valleys, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 230]</a></span>
had to return quite unsuccessful, and I can only
conclude that this water was permitted by a kind
Providence to remain here in this lovely spot for my
especial benefit.... I have, in gratitude, called
it Mount Udor, as being the only one in this region
where a drop of that requisite element was to be
obtained. And when I left the udor had departed
also." This incident occurred at the twenty-first camp
from Chambers's Pillar. From this point a persevering,
but unsuccessful, effort was made to strike out west in
the direction of a chain named Ehrenberg's Mountain.
Want of water again forced the party back on Mount
Udor. A more southerly route led to the important
discovery of a great saltwater lake, which was called
Amadeus, after the then King of Spain, son of Victor
Emanuel. Beyond this long, but comparatively narrow,
sheet of water, a conspicuous mountain, named Olga,
specially attracted the attention of Mr. Giles, who was
anxious to reach it by rounding the lake. But this
labour was prevented by an incident which, unhappily,
caused the purpose of the expedition to collapse.
Robinson had been seized with homesickness, and the
infection reached Carmichael, who obstinately refused
to proceed any further. Giles tried the effect of
moral suasion, which was the only weapon available
for a volunteer. He pleaded the large supply of
provisions, the importance of the enterprise, and the
ignominy of turning back. But it was to no purpose.
Carmichael had made up his mind and would listen to
no arguments. Giles was now compelled to direct his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 231]</a></span>
march back to the telegraph line, "a baffled and
beaten man." During this inglorious retreat the
course lay by the Peterman, the Palmer, and the
Finke rivers, and by this route the original camp
No. 1 was reached. Here is the conclusion of the
whole matter in Mr. Giles's own words:&mdash;"My expedition
was over. I had failed in my object (to
penetrate to the sources of the Murchison River)
certainly, but not through any fault of mine, as I
think any impartial reader of my journal will
admit.... We travelled to the eastward
along the course of the River Finke (homeward),
and passed a few miles to the south of Chambers's
Pillar, which had been my starting-point. I had
left it but twelve weeks and four days to the
time I re-sighted it, and during that interval I had
traversed and laid down about a thousand miles of
country. My expedition thus early ends. Had I
been fortunate enough to have fallen upon a good, or
even fair, line of country, the distance I actually
travelled would have taken me across the continent."</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>A second attempt was made by the same explorer
shortly after his return from the first. The funds
being provided by the liberality of the Victorian
colonists, a light party, consisting of Messrs. Giles,
Tietkens, Gibson, and Andrews, with twenty-four
horses, were despatched for the purpose of crossing
the western half of Australia. They left the telegraph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 232]</a></span>
road at the junction of the Stevenson and
Alberga creeks on the 4th of August, 1873. The
latter was followed for some distance westward, after
which, by a short cross-country route to the north,
the Hamilton River was reached, and taken as a guide
so far as was practicable. This journey led to the
discovery of four remarkable mountain-chains. The
first of these was named Anthony Range. From one
of the summits they beheld a sea of mountains, countless
in number, many of which presented the most
comically fantastic shapes and forms which the
imagination can conceive. Ayer's Range was next
reached, and an equally commanding view obtained
from one of its heights. The next was the Musgrave
Range, occupying a central position in a far-reaching
expanse of good country. Here the natives were
encountered in a hostile attitude, but were beaten off
by the superior arms of four white men. After a
journey of 400 miles they reached Mt. Olga, which
had been sighted on the former expedition. In this
neighbourhood also, they found the tracks of Mr.
Gosse, a contemporary explorer, which led to a deviation
from the proposed route. In Cavanagh's Range
a dep√¥t was established, as a basis for tentative explorations
in a forbidding tract of country. About 110
miles from this centre they made a welcome discovery
of a waterfall of 150 feet, sending forth a musical
roar as it fell, and scattering around a plentiful shower
of spray. This gladdening apparition in the desert
received the name of the Alice Falls. The country in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the immediate neighbourhood was also well grassed.
This place has doubtless a future in store for it.
Turning more to the north, in the direction of a
broken country, another splendid range, named
the Rawlinson, was discovered. It extended to 60
miles in length, with a breadth of five or six.
The peaks were remarkably pointed and jagged.
From this position an attempt was made to
strike out in a north-westerly direction, but bad
fortune compelled them to return after Mt.
Destruction had been reached. Four of the horses
had been lost in a journey of ninety miles; water
was not to be found; the natives were troublesome;
and the eye could discern nothing ahead but
spinifex desert and rolling sand-hills. A return to
the Rawlinson Range was, therefore, imperative.
Having again rested for a little, another determined
effort was made to force a passage due west across the
interior and strike the outposts of settlement in
Western Australia. All was done that man could do,
but impossibilities are not to be accomplished. The
western flanks of the Rawlinson Range faded away
into a barren and waterless desert. Giles and Gibson
had, as a gigantic effort of perseverance, penetrated
98 miles into this inhospitable waste. But no further
could they go. Here, on the 23rd of April, the utmost
bourne of the expedition was reached. One of the
two horses here knocked up and died. This was the
last time Gibson was seen. Giles did his utmost to
bring him help, but he was never found. His bones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 234]</a></span>
lie somewhere in that awful wilderness, which to this
day bears his name. When the furthest point was
reached better fortune seemed to loom in the distance.
Another range of lofty mountains was descried
athwart the western horizon, which he called the
Alfred and Marie, after the Duke and Duchess of
Edinburgh. They might as well have been in the moon
so far as Mr. Giles was concerned in his now pitiable
plight. His own reflections were deplorably bitter:&mdash;"The
hills bounding the western horizon were between
thirty and forty miles away, and it was with extreme
regret that I was compelled to relinquish a further
attempt to reach them. Oh, how ardently I longed
for a camel; how ardently I gazed upon the scene!
At this moment I would even my jewel eternal have
sold for power to span that gulf that lay between.
But it could not be; situated as I was, I was compelled
to retreat, and the sooner the better." Such was his
destiny. After almost twelve months' wanderings in
the wilderness, three of the four explorers escaped
with their lives, and reached the central telegraph
line on the 13th of July.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Such battling with relentless fortune would have
extinguished the spirit of adventure in most men.
In the case of Mr. Giles it fanned it into a brighter
flame. Refusing to be baffled, his noble perseverance
was at length rewarded with a double journey across
the western half of the continent. This expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 235]</a></span>
was fitted out by Sir Thomas Elder, of Adelaide, who
supplied him with nineteen camels and provisions for
eighteen months. The party consisted of Messrs.
Giles, Tietkens, Young, A. Ross, P. Nicholls, Selah
(an Afghan), and a black boy. The route proposed
was from Youldah to Perth, and the start was made
on the 27th July, 1875. This, though a successful,
was a very trying journey. They crossed desert
after desert for a distance of 1,500 miles. On one
occasion they were reduced to the last extremity of
thirst, and saved from perishing by the happy discovery
of a spring in the Great Victoria Desert, 600
miles from the out-settlements of Western Australia.
They reached Perth on the 10th November, having
travelled a distance of 2,575 miles in about five
months. The following is Mr. Giles's summary of the
journey:&mdash;"The expedition has been successful, yet
the country traversed for more than a thousand miles
in a straight line was simply an undulating bed of
dense scrub, except between the 125th and 127th
meridians, the latitude being nearly the 30th parallel.
Here an arm of the Great Southern Plain ran up and
crossed our track, which, though grassy, was quite
waterless. The waters were, indeed, few and far
between throughout. On one occasion, a stretch of
desert was encountered in which no water was
obtainable for 325 miles, which only the marvellous
sustaining powers of Mr. Elder's all-enduring beasts
enabled us to cross. The next desert was only 180
miles to a mass of granite, where I saw natives for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the first time on the expedition. They attacked us
there, but we managed to drive them off. Mount
Churchman was now only 160 miles distant, and we
found water again before reaching it. We struck in
at Toora, an out-station, where the shepherd was very
hospitable. At other homesteads we were most
kindly welcomed." By another journey, in a reverse
direction, across the western interior, Mr. Giles
returned to the central telegraph, which for so long
had formed his base of operations. Leaving Perth on
the 13th of January, 1876, he pushed north, and
struck the Ashburton River, thence passed through
150 miles of desert, and from the opposite side reached
the Alfred and Marie Range, from which he had been
so piteously thrust back in 1873. He soon after
reached the Rawlinson Range, which he had discovered
on that same expedition. Being now in a
known country, he passed safely through it, and
reached the Peak telegraph station on the 23rd of
August, 1876. His journey thence to Adelaide was
ordinary travel in the Australian bush.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<h3>OTHER EXPLORERS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA.&mdash;CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p>There still remain a considerable number of the
explorers of Western Australia, whose achievements,
though inferior to the foregoing, would have called for
particular notice had this been an exhaustive work.
A very brief outline of the journeys of the most
prominent is all that can be attempted here. We
shall begin with Captain, afterwards Sir George, Grey,
so well known in later times as a new Zealand
statesman. From 1837 to 1840 he was occupied with
two expeditions for the exploration of the country
lying between the coast and the first range. Both
journeys were exceedingly hazardous&mdash;none more so in
this department of history. During the first Prince
Regent's River was explored; but the most important
result was the discovery of the River Glenelg, which
was described as one of the finest in Australia. The
second expedition was directed to Shark's Bay, which
was reached in February, 1839. The most important
discovery during this journey was the River Gascoyne.
The expedition was soon overtaken by terrible
misfortunes, which compelled the party to make for
Swan River by the quickest route. The first attempt
was made in a small boat, which got no further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 238]</a></span>
than Gantheaume Bay, where it was dashed to pieces
on the beach. To save their lives they had now to
walk on foot along an inhospitable coast for 300
miles, with no more provisions than twenty pounds of
flour and one pound of pork to each man. Grey
struggled along and gave a heroic example to the men
under his charge. When he arrived at Perth he
looked like a spectre, and his most intimate friends
did not know him. He has himself told us what was
the secret of his moral strength:&mdash;"It may be asked,"
he said, "if, during such a trying period, I did not
seek from religion that consolation which it is sure to
afford. My answer is, yes; and I further feel assured
that but for the support I derived from prayer and
frequent perusal of the Scriptures, I should never
have been able to have borne myself in such a manner
as to have maintained discipline and confidence
among the rest of the party; nor in my sufferings did
I ever lose the consolation derived from a firm reliance
upon the goodness of Providence. It is only those
who go forth into perils and dangers, amidst which
human foresight and strength can but little avail, and
who find themselves day after day protected by an
unseen influence, and ever and anon snatched from
the very jaws of destruction by a power which is not
of this world, who can at all estimate the knowledge
of one's own weakness and littleness, and the firm
reliance and trust upon the goodness of the Creator
which the human heart is capable of feeling."</p>

<p>The next in order is Mr. J. S. Roe, Surveyor-General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of Western Australia. With a party of six
men, eleven horses, and four months' provisions, he
started from York in September, 1848, for the
southern part of the colony. Leaving the last stations
of the River Avon, he went S. 1/2 S. in a direction
which had not yet been explored. In a short time he
got into a poor country, which contained the heads of
the Avon, the Williams, the Arthur, and other rivers.
In 45 miles further he came to the Pallinup River, the
last water which had been crossed by Eyre on his
journey along the Great Bight. He followed it to the
neighbourhood of Cape Riche, the latter part of this
stage being through a well-grassed country. Here a
squatting station was found, and a much-needed rest
obtained. The next effort was to make the Bremer
Range. In the intervening part, a river, the Jeeramungup,
was discovered in a good tract of country,
which was again succeeded by poor land. The Bremer
Range was reached by the 3rd November. There was
a hard journey thence to the Russell Range, which
was near Eyre's country, and of the same description.
The coast was reached opposite the Recherche Archipelago.
Roe had now travelled 1,000 miles from
Swan River, and found it necessary to return, and in
doing so kept very much to Eyre's track as far as
Cape Riche. The most important result of this
journey was the discovery of several seams of coal.
The return to Perth was made by way of the Pallinup
River. The party had been absent 149 days, and
travelled 1,800 miles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>The third explorer who shall be briefly noticed is
Mr. R. Austin, who was Assistant Surveyor-General.
He was despatched by the Government to search for
gold in the country north and east of the settled
districts. The party consisted of ten men, twenty-seven
horses, and 120 days' provisions. By the 10th
of July, 1854, they had left the head of Swan River,
and entered on a wretchedly poor country, in which
all the bushes were dead. Another fifty miles' travel
brought them to a table-land with some high mountains,
the most conspicuous of which received the
name of Mt. Kenneth. Soon after a severe mishap
befell the expedition. The horses having eaten a
poisonous plant, twenty-four died within a few hours,
leaving the explorers in a very helpless condition.
They pushed on, nevertheless, and displayed an
admirable perseverance. On the 24th of August
they reached a magnetic hill, which was called Mt.
Magnet, and returned for rest to Recruit Flat. The
country next traversed lay between the Great Salt
Lake and West Mt. Magnet, dry, rough, and stony
throughout. One curious discovery was a cave with
life-like figures of animals drawn by the aborigines.
Some similar exhibitions of savage art had previously
been discovered by other explorers in the north and
west. The party came again to poisonous bushes, and
the horses had to be watched night and day. Thence,
taking a westward course, they got within fifty miles
of Shark's Bay, when want of food compelled them
to retreat to the Geraldine mines on the Murchison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 241]</a></span>
River. Here the party broke up, some returning to
Perth by sea and the rest overland. The expedition
failed in its principal object; nor was it in other
respects much of a success.</p>

<p>It would be unpardonable to close this list without
mention of Mr. F. T. Gregory's services in the
exploration of West Australia. In April, 1858, he led
an expedition from the Geraldine mines to examine the
country between the Gascoyne River and Mt. Murchison.
This effort was attended with much success.
At least a million acres of good land were discovered&mdash;quite
a Godsend for this colony, which is so rich in
deserts. The principal places discovered and named
were Mt. Nairn, Lockyer Range, Lyons River, the
Alma, and Mt. Hall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is but right to add that the exploration of the
interior has been largely indebted to private enterprise,
of which there is no particular record. The
pioneer squatters, in search of "fresh fields and
pastures new," have not been afraid to invade unknown
territories, nor have they gone without their
reward. When a fine patch of country has been
discovered they have usually been quite willing to
sacrifice their merit as explorers to the caresses of
private fortune, being mindful, perhaps, of the old
proverb which tells us "the crow would have more to
eat if he were less noisy over his food." The same
cause has been helped on, also, by the search for gold,
than which nothing will entice man further from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 242]</a></span>
home, or collect them in greater crowds. In this
way much available country has lately been opened
up in the Kimberley district of Western Australia, and
the process is still going on, with many promising
prospects. It is extremely probable that this northern
region will soon be reckoned one of that colony's most
valuable possessions, both in the squatting and the
mining interests.</p>

<p>As the combined result of all the foregoing agencies,
Australia has virtually ceased to be an unknown land
by the close of the first century of our history. Even
the great desert of Western Australia, real or supposed,
has been crossed again and again, while lesser
enterprises, issuing from all sides, have carried the
fringe of the known territory further and further
inland. Even yet the spirit of exploration keeps
awake, and refuses to rest so long as a patch of the
interior remains to be examined. While these sheets
are passing through the press an exploring party,
supported again by Adelaide, are preparing for the
interior, in order to wrest from its grasp such secrets
as it may yet retain.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to observe how a better acquaintance
with Australia, both in the way of discovery and
settlement, is surely leading on to the belief that it
will yet be the home of a numerous population. For
a long period it was reckoned unfit to be the habitation
of civilized man, except along the seaboards. The
want of water, and continuous deserts, were supposed
to have placed the interior beyond the pale of settlement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 243]</a></span>
But experience has already revealed a system
of compensations by which this hasty judgment has
come to be reversed, and the back country settled by a
thriving population. There are deserts, indeed, in
which one might search in vain for a blade of grass,
but they contain many patches of nutritious shrubs,
which not only keep alive, but even fatten, stock.
Water, too, is scarce, but, by another of these
admirable compensations, it is capable of being stored
in any quantity, and for any length of time, without
becoming putrid&mdash;an advantage unknown to the
home countries. The rainfall, moreover, is very scant
&mdash;perhaps not more than seven inches per annum in
the far interior&mdash;but then the recent borings with the
diamond drill have shown that an abundant supply
may be obtained from subterranean sources. The
latest announcement made to us, now standing on the
threshold of the centennial year, is the most encouraging
of all. By the ticking of the telegraph we
learn that an experiment at Barcaldine, in Queensland,
has brought to the surface of the bore a daily
discharge of something approaching to 100,000 gallons
of water fit for all purposes. Experience is ever
revealing new relations of material adaptability.
There is a sympathy between a country and its
inhabitants, which may have a deeper foundation than
the fancy of the poet. The land and the people are
the complements of one another. "God made the
earth to be inhabited," and there is now no fear of
Australia being an exception to the rule.</p>
